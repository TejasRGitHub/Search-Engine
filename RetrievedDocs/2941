About the electrical and computer engineering faculty

The electrical and computer engineering department is among the newest of the UIC College of Engineering’s six departments, making its debut in 2001 when it was split off from what had been a shared department that housed both ECE and computer science. As separate entities, the two departments continue to work together closely and cooperatively, pursuing collaborative research and enrolling students in courses across disciplines.
UIC electrical and computer engineering has 38 full-time faculty members. Ten are either current or past recipients of the National Science Foundation’s prestigious CAREER award, and many of our faculty are fellows of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and other professional societies.
Electrical and computer engineering traces its roots to the origin of the UIC College of Engineering in 1965, when faculty members in these disciplines were part of what was called the Department of Information Engineering. In more than a half-century, the disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering at UIC have undergone both an evolution and an expansion, representing areas of research excellence as well as popular academic choices for current students.
We invite you to explore this website to learn more about ECE at UIC. This section about our faculty and staff will introduce you to the people who drive research, teaching, and learning in our department. We encourage you in particular to explore our research section to find out about our current scholarly investigations: the research areas page is a valuable starting point if you would like to find ECE areas of expertise, and our featured research page offers a snapshot of selected up-and-coming studies.
