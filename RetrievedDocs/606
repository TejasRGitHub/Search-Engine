The UIC Library has four physical locations in three Illinois cities, in addition to the UIC School of Law Library.  Please see our Library Hours.  For UIC campus-level maps, see UIC Maps.
Currently, UIC Library buildings are open only to UIC-affiliated patrons (with an active NetID and i-Card), or patrons from other I-Share libraries (with an ID card from their institution).

For NetID information, see the UIC NetID center.
For i-Card information, see the UIC ID Center.

Masks are required.
Check Out a Book
The book stacks are open.  Visitors may opt instead to locate and request books online before visiting, to pick up from the circulation desk or through low-contact delivery.
Special Collections and University Archives
Special Collections access is currently by advance appointment only, perhaps with separate visiting hours.  See Visit Special Collections for more information.
Food and Drink
Food is not currently permitted in the Library.  Drinks are OK, but only in covered containers.  See Can I eat or drink in the Library for more information.
