Every year we co-sponsor the Fall Scavenger Hunt. This event takes place in the CS lounge, where both students and professors are placed into teams. Each member in the team are at a different level depending on what computer science courses they have taken (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, & 4xx courses) with one professor per team. They are given a set of problems to solve & find throughout the UIC’s east campus.
There’s food, friendships, and a great time! Our scavenger hunt this fall semester was a success. Thank you for everyone who made this a successful event.

Due to being online during the Fall 2020 semester, we had a virtual scavenger hunt! Students and faculty came together in teams to solve computer science problems. Each team consisted of different class-level students (1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX) along with a professor.
A huge thank you to all the faculty that donated their time to join the students for this event. It was a HUGE success!

We were so excited to hold our first in-person scavenger hunt since 2019! Students and faculty came together in teams to solve some Halloween-themed computer science problems and compete for some UIC CS goodies. Each team consisted of different class-level students (1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX) and a professor.
Thank you to everyone involved in making this event SPOOKtacular!
