IEEE and its members inspire a global community through IEEE’s highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards and professional and educational activities. If you ever have a chance to read through our professors’ resumes you’ll see that more than a few are IEEE  fellows. An IEEE fellowship is the highest grade of membership attained through nomination by peers and approval by the IEEE Board  of Directors for distinction in the profession.
