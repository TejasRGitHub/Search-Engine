This presents a unique opportunity for graduate students from diverse disciplines to develop sophisticated aesthetic sensibilities while becoming competent users / developers of advanced interactive computer graphics technology.Students, faculty and staff collaborate on large-scale projects for public events, as well as individual participation in art exhibitions, scientific demonstrations, paper presentations in conferences, symposiums, and festivals on a regular basis.Students can take lecture and seminar courses from evl faculty on User Interface Design, Video Game Design, Visualization and Visual Analytics, Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Animation, and GPU Programming.Graduate and Undergraduate students who have shown interest and ability through the related course-work or through volunteering to work on evl-related projects may be offered support as research assistants to work on funded projects in the lab.Graduate StudentsEVL graduate students receive MS and/or PhD degree through UIC's Department of Computer Science. For more information on applying to the graduate program see the CS Graduate Admissions webpage.Undergraduate StudentsUndergraduate students interested in evl-related work should elect the Human Centered Computing Concentration within the BS in Computer Science program.Contact UIC.edu  - Computer Science  - Academic Calendar  - Campus Directory   - Maps
