Alternate Format Request Form
In order to ensure receipt of alternate formate materials in a timely manner, students must complete the following form at least two weeks in advance of when the text is needed. In rare instances, alternate format may take longer than two weeks to complete; in these cases the DRC will be in contact with the student and their instructor about timeline.
Please note: alternate format requests are not retroactive. Course material will be converted from the week the request is submitted.
Once requested materials are ready for use, they will either be uploaded to your Kurzweil Universal Library or sent to you via the UIC cloud platform, Box. For a tutorial on setting up a Box account for the first time, follow this link: Link to Box Set-Up Instructions.
Feel free to reach out to the alternate format team with any questions or concerns at any time by emailing accesstext@uic.edu.
