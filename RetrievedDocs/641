Request Library Instruction






Request Library Instruction
Course Instructors can request Library instruction to help students better employ Library resources.
Library instruction sessions prepare students to find, evaluate and utilize information found through library research tools. Librarians work with UIC faculty to create sessions relevant to course assignments such as research papers. We are available to meet with your students in a variety of ways tailored to student needs.
