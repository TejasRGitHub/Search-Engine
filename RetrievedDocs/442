With approximately 2,950 faculty members and a low 1-to-19 faculty-student ratio, UIC undergraduates have exceptional access to the scientists, artists, writers, clinicians, educators and innovators whose work shapes our world.
 Undergraduate faculty  Graduate faculty Arts and humanitiesUIC courses in the arts and humanities help students develop critical-thinking skills and a comprehensive world view.
The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a diverse community of artists, architects, designers and performers. Humanities studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences —  including the School of Literatures, Cultural Studies and Linguistics — reflect the global identities of UIC and Chicago.
 College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts  College of Education  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Be innovativeThe UIC Innovation Center is a place for collaboration, education and incubation that brings together industry, educators and students to find solutions to real-world problems. Students in the MAD Lab (Medical Accelerator for Devices) created a diagnostic tool for women’s health exams.
More about the Innovation CenterBasic and social sciencesWhether you want to view the world through an electron microscope or the perspective of an entire culture, UIC offers a broad range of programs in the basic and social sciences. UIC researchers study important issues like energy production and conservation, the survival of wildlife in the city, the cultures of lost Amazonian civilizations and the behaviors that surround binge-drinking. Their work translates into classroom learning and student research opportunities.
 College of Liberal Arts and Sciences BusinessUIC produces leaders for the global economy of the future. The College of Business Administration reinforces the core disciplines — accounting, finance, information and decision sciences, marketing and management — with solid, real-world experience.
For students whose career goals expand beyond one area of study, UIC offers joint degree options that combine business with medicine, public health, pharmacy, economics, nursing and management information systems.
 College of Business Administration  Joint degree programs See the futuresToday’s financial trading relies on high-speed software and instant access to real-time information from enormous volumes of data. In its market training lab, UIC’s International Center for Futures and Derivatives teaches students in an environment that simulates the trading room at a big investment firm.

Researchers at UIC are developing cleaner fuel options and studying practical applications for the 2D “wonder material” graphene and using AI to improve treatment recommendations for patients with cancer. If you’re interested in computer science — gaming, manipulation of big data, computers that understand natural language or visualization, securing healthcare data, the intersection of art and science — you’ll find it at UIC.
 College of Engineering  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  The Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering  MAD Lab  Biomedical and Health Information Sciences Break Through Tech ChicagoBreak Through Tech Chicago, housed in UIC’s computer science department, closes the gender gap in the tech world by preparing more women (cis and trans) and nonbinary individuals with an undergraduate education in technical fields, especially computer science and data science. Break Through Tech Chicago is funded by Melinda Gates’ Pivotal Ventures, the Cognizant U.S. Foundation, and Verizon.
More about Break Through TechHealth sciencesTogether, UIC’s seven health sciences colleges and hospital system – called UI Health – provides opportunities for students to develop clinical skills, to engage in laboratory and community-based research initiatives, and to explore countless health care related careers from medical care providers to data and policy experts to biomedical visualization artists. Ten pre-health programs in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences prepare students for future study in UIC health sciences programs and veterinary medicine.
For students whose goals expand beyond one area of study, UIC offers joint degrees that combine health care studies with other disciplines. The Medical Scientist Training Program is an MD/Ph.D. program that prepares students to be physician-scientists, who can help combine laboratory, clinical sciences and interdisciplinary approaches to important biomedical problems. The Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering, a partnership between the College of Medicine and the College of Engineering, trains students for careers in biomaterials, neural engineering, biosensors, biomechanics, genetic engineering and bionanotechnology, to name a few.

The new Schwartz Experiential Learning & Simulation Laboratory is among the largest at any U.S. nursing school. Together, these simulation centers and others on campus facilitate more than 50,000 hours of hands-on learning in the health sciences.

The College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs offers undergraduate and degrees, including Chicago’s only accredited graduate program in urban planning.  Eight research centers specialize in neighborhood development, economics, transportation, race and public policy, criminal justice and other issues.
 College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs Gentrification or not?A gentrification index developed by UIC researchers measures neighborhood change in Chicago’s 77 community areas. It quantifies each area’s residents by ethnicity, age, education, income, occupation, home ownership and home values. Researchers found more neighborhoods declining than gentrifying, despite concerns that long-time residents are being priced out of some areas.
