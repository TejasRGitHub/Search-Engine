Advising
Before you apply to your new college, you can use the links to your intended college on the home page to determine what you need.
Advising in your new college once you are admitted is essential for a successful transition. As you transfer into your new college, it is important to ensure that you provide information for your new advisor.
Please either complete the downloadable pdf   or the online webform that you can print and use for your first interaction with your new advisor. This will help your advisor get to know you better and begin customizing your academic plan.
