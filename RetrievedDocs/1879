Q: Do we have to use a condom if my partner is on birth control?
A: Condoms are not just for preventing pregnancy.  Condoms, when used properly prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STI’s).  To prevent STI’s it is important to always use a condom before engaging in sexual activity.
Q: What is the point of oral sex condoms and dental dams and when should they be used?
A: Oral sex condoms and dental dams are to be used when engaging in oral sex.  Many STI’s such as, Chlamydia, Herpes, Human Papillomavirus, HIV, and Trichomoniasis are transmissible through oral sex.
Q: Do condom use prevents ALL types of STDs?
A: Condoms do not prevent all STDs. Herpes, Genital Warts, or Pubic Lice can still be transmitted through skin on skin contact even with proper condom usage.
Q: What are the symptoms of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)?
A: A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system, the kidneys, bladder or urethra.  Symptoms may vary from person to person but many people feel a burning sensation when urinating, frequent or intense urge to urinate, pain or pressure in back or lower abdomen, cloudy, dark, or smelly urine, feeling tired or shaky, and/or fever or chills.  It is important that you seek a health care provider as soon as you suspect that you may have a UTI.  UTI’s are commonly treated with antibiotics.
Q: Can bacterial STDs be cured with antibiotics, while viral STDs have no cure and you are infected for life?
A: Bacterial STDs such as Bacterial Vaginosis, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotic regimens and cured. Viral STDs such as HPV and HIV cannot be cured and may require lifelong treatment with the progression of the disease.
Q: Can I use the same condom twice if I don’t ejaculate?
A: No, once you have put on a condom it is important that it stays on.  Once you take it off, it should be discarded.  Condoms are only meant to be used one time and if not used properly the effectiveness is compromised.
Q: Can I get pregnant if I had unprotected sex during my menstrual cycle?
A: There is always a chance of pregnancy when you have sex, especially unprotected.  Abstinence is the only way to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancy.
Q: Do I still need to use a condom when having anal sex?
A: Absolutely! You should always use protection when having anal sex.  STI’s such as Chlamydia, Herpes, Genital Warts, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis B, HIV, and Syphilis.  There are higher risks of bacterial infections such as Hepatitis A and E. Coli (fecal matter) when engaging in anal sex.  Due to the sensitive membrane around the anus, contact with blood is likely.
Q: Can rectal douching too often cause damage to rectal tissue, throw off your electrolyte balance, and disrupt your body’s natural elimination rhythm?
A: Overdoing it with a rectal douche can irritate the rectal tissue, putting you at a higher risk of infection. Using water is fine with occasional use, but too much can disrupt your electrolyte balance. Saline enema solution is better, but can still lead to imbalances with overuse. Ideally, this should only be done a maximum of 2-3 times a week.
Remember, rectal douching is not necessary! If you prefer to because that is what makes you most comfortable, do it safely
Q: When should I take emergency contraceptives after having unprotected sex?
A: Emergency contraceptives are most effective when taken within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex.
Types of emergency contraceptive: Plan B, PEP
Q: Which population would pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) be an option for?
A: PrEP is for those who are at a very high risk of HIV infection. Taking PrEP daily can lower their chance of getting infected. Talk to your doctor if you think PrEP is right for you.
