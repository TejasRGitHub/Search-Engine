College of Engineering 


















Welcome to UIC’s ASME official website!
The full name of this organization is American Society of Mechanical Engineers UIC Chapter.
Our goal is to provide professional and academic skill sets in order for its members to be prepared for the real world of engineering. To become a member of the society, one has to be a student of UIC.
We hold General Body Meetings(GBM’s) at least once per month where we invite engineers from companies/organizations such as Molex or CIA to provide internship opportunities and a way to communicate with engineers who work in the field.
