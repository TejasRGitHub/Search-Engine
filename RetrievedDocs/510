Assistive Technology Certificate
Deliver state-of-the-art assistive technology services and solutions to individuals with disabilities
UIC’s Certificate Program in Assistive Technology is a flexible package of 13 graduate-level credit hours* designed to train individuals to deliver state-of-the-art assistive technology clinical services and solutions for people with physical, cognitive and/or sensory disabilities. Learn how to analyze a person’s interaction with their environment, help them select effective technology, and support their use of tools through implementation and follow-up training.
Complete our program entirely online or through a combination of online and on-campus, lab-based courses. Each course is taught by recognized assistive technology professionals who work in a variety of settings and have extensive experience in their area of focus. Our core faculty are senior clinicians in the UIC Assistive Technology Unit and RESNA-Certified assistive technology professionals. Courses can be taken individually without enrolling in the certificate program.
* Starting spring 2022. The requirement for current students is 12 credit hours.

Your Career

Providing access for people with disabilities to learn, live, work and play more independently in the community is a growing part of many different fields of practice. Our certificate will expand your professional training in fields such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech language pathology, pecial education, engineering and vocational rehabilitation (we have two CRCC preapproved courses).

Understanding by doing

You’ll get hands-on experiences so you’re ready for real-world situations. Get in-depth training on topics like:

Computers, communication and controls in rehabilitation technology: Learn how to evaluate access methods and controls used to operate computers, communication devices and powered wheelchairs, and investigate device features and integration factors.
Augmentative communication assessment: Examine strategies and evaluation materials, including case example discussions of specific approaches for different ages, disabilities, and settings. You’ll work directly with speech-generating devices and gain hands-on experience using a variety of access methods, rate enhancement techniques and vocabulary expansion tools.
Consideration and assessment in K12 Settings: Work with your own real-life student in a case study project that takes you through all stages of AT consideration, assessment, implementation, and documentation. Design and deliver an AT assessment and get real results you can share with your team.
Adaptive equipment design and fabrication: Explore custom design and fabrication of low-tech adaptive equipment. Practice sessions put you to work in our Assistive Technology Unit shop, where you’ll complete an individual project based on actual consumer request.
