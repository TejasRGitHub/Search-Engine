The Graduate College offers a number of fellowships and awards, totaling almost $2 million, to graduate students. We also administer or liaise with funding agencies for additional opportunities. In Graduate College parlance, “fellowships” carry a stipend, for one or multiple years, as well as a tuition and partial fee waiver; they are used both to recruit new students and to help current students to complete their studies. “Awards” promote research, provide funds for a unique experience, or highlight achievement.
The majority of the Graduate College’s internal awards and fellowships are reviewed by our elected faculty awards committees, which are split into four disciplinary divisions: Arts and Humanities (AH), Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSS), Engineering, Math, and Physical Sciences (EMPS), and Life Sciences (LS).
Our funding opportunities appear below, first fellowships and then awards. Most are run through the Fellowships Office; however, since submission policies vary, instructions should be read carefully.
Please note:  Per HR rules, students cannot simultaneously hold faculty or staff (“employee class”) positions, including hourly appointments, and receive a Graduate College fellowship or award unless the employment is a graduate assistantship or graduate hourly.

The Graduate College offers several fellowships to support University of Illinois Chicago graduate students. Students do not apply directly for these awards. Instead, academic programs submit nominations. Students who wish to be nominated should contact their director of graduate studies (DGS) for details.
Except where noted, Graduate College fellowships carry a stipend of $26,000 as well as a tuition and partial fee waiver. Recruitment fellowships are multi-year funding packages that include fellowship years as well as an academic program-provided employment period which may be “topped” off up to the value of the fellowship stipend. Retention/completion fellowships are for a single year of stipend along with the waiver.

            Pipeline to an Inclusive Faculty (PIF) Fellowship
          

Acknowledging the lack of diversity in faculty around the country, we wanted to build a program at UIC to recruit and support outstanding underrepresented PhD students, who are interested in pursuing careers as faculty members.Our intent is to support these students with competitive funding packages, skills and professional development opportunities and mentoring in order to ensure their success in graduate school and in their future careers. Nomination by the academic program is required.

                            Access to Excellence Fellowship
                    








            Access to Excellence Fellowship
          

The goal of the Access to Excellence Fellowship is to increase the number of students from historically underrepresented groups in graduate education who enter careers as researchers and college faculty. Historically underrepresented groups include: African American, Latinx, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islanders.
Formerly the Abraham Lincoln Fellowship, the Access to Excellence Fellowship (AF) has two rounds of applications: recruitment and retention. Both require a nomination by the academic program.

The award is intended to provide the most distinguished, advanced-level graduate students with a period of time dedicated solely to the completion of their programs. The Dean’s Scholar competition is open to (a) doctoral students who have passed the Graduate College-required Preliminary Examination and are well into their dissertation work, and (b) MFA students who have passed their second-semester review. Nominations must come from the program.

                            Graduate Student Excellence in Teaching and Mentoring Award
                    








            Graduate Student Excellence in Teaching and Mentoring Award (GSETMA)
          

The Honors College and the Graduate College at the University of Illinois Chicago are proud to announce the return of their award to highlight excellence of our graduate teaching and mentoring of undergraduates.

                            Provost's Graduate Internship Award
                    








            Provost's Graduate Internship Award
          

Increasingly, graduate students are seeking positions outside the traditional tenure-track professoriate. To this end, the Graduate College has greatly enhanced its career and professional development offerings to help graduate students consider new career options and to build translatable skills. In an annual spring competition, the PGIA incentivizes graduate students to independently identify short (3-month) internship opportunities that might lead to employment following graduation. Students in programs with mandatory internships as part of their curriculum are ineligible. Full description and instructions.

            Provost's Graduate Research Award
          

Since its inception in 2009, this award has supported multidisciplinary scholarship to expose students to varied research and creative fields. The award mechanism has naturally evolved into a way for students early in their studies to develop new research directions for their PhD dissertations or terminal degree thesis/capstone project and has been used by graduate programs as a way for students to practice writing research proposals. Funding is available for pilot grants (or preliminary research) to help students to develop stronger applications for funding from external sources.

                            Public Service Graduate Internship Award (retired)
                    








            Public Service Graduate Internship Award
          

The Graduate College at the University of Illinois Chicago created an award in order to fund graduate students who were suddenly unfunded for the summer of 2020 due to the global pandemic.
Inspired by the New Deal and its public works projects as well as by the university’s own mission, the Graduate College created the Public Service Graduate Internship Award (PSGIA). This paid summer experience allowed UIC graduate students to serve in the interest of the public good while obtaining valuable “hands-on” experience, albeit virtually. In addition to service for the public good, students received virtual experience in academic, administrative, and student service units at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Student Presenter Awards
The Graduate College offers funds to deserving students to defray expenses associated with travel to present original research or scholarly work. Qualifying presentations must be at a meeting or conference of a nationally or internationally recognized scientific or scholarly society. Awards may be used for transportation, hotel, meals, and/or registration expenses.

            The Image of Research
          

The Image of Research is an annual interdisciplinary exhibit competition organized by the Graduate College and University Library to showcase the breadth and diversity of research at UIC. Each year, students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program at UIC are invited to submit an image they created along with a brief précis of how the image relates to the student’s overall research. A multi-disciplinary jury reviews the submissions and awards prizes to 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners and three honorable mentions for still-image submissions, and 1st and 2nd place winners for moving images submissions.
