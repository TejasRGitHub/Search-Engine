The chart shows the number of new student and employee cases reported to the UIC COVID-19 Contact Tracing & Epidemiology Program, by day, over the past 30 days.
Daily COVID-19 incidence (or the occurrence of new cases) is currently approximately 7.1 cases per day and has been decreasing since November 3, at which time we reached approximately 15 cases per day, a trend likely associated with indoor Halloween gatherings. Compared to the previous week, campus incidence during the week ending November 22 was down approximately 32%.
Please note that there is no Shield saliva testing November 23-27, 2022, for the Thanksgiving holiday.

The rolling average of new student and employee cases reported each day to our program are represented using two trend lines, moving left to right, with the heights of lines indicating the number of cases.
Cases included campus members who tested positive at a Shield unobserved testing site or any other UI Health testing location, and cases who self-reported a positive test obtained off campus, including home tests. Students who are also employed by the university were classified as students. Employees who work for UI Health and individuals who could not be classified as a student or employee were excluded from this figure. Individuals who tested positive more than once within 90 days were counted as a case only once and plotted on the figure according to the first positive specimen collection date.
