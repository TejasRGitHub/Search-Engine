Black History Month


Posted on February 11, 2022


The UIC Counseling Center stands firmly in support of Black History Month amid controversy and violence threatening its validity. We offer our solidarity to those who have suffered threats this month, including those at historically black colleges and universities, and who have feared both for their safety to exist in their own skin. The acknowledgment of Black suffering and the celebration of Black excellence are critical components of the past, present, and future of our nation, and we join in this engagement with Black visibility alongside our UIC community.
We understand that our Black community may be feeling fearful, angry, despairing, or any number of other feelings  – each of these and the ways they intersect together is valid and deserving of attention and understanding. We encourage you to seek the comforts of your culture and your community and to speak with trusted others about how you feel. The Counseling Center is available to talk with you at our weekly Space for Support and Healing, as well as any number of appointments or events that you can learn about on our website. For additional online resources and ways to celebrate Black History Month, please see below.
Sincerely,
The UIC Counseling Center Staff
