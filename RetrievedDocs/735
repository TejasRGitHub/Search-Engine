Housing Instability

Although housing instability can be a difficult issue to discuss, it is more common than we may think. Almost three in five college students experience housing instability at one point during their time at University, and the COVID-19 Pandemic has shown us how inequities in housing can affect our ability to maintain a stable health and lifestyle.  Housing Instability can affect you in many ways and for different periods of time, but there are a multitude of resources available to help UIC students at this time.  It is important to feel stable in where you live and work during college.  The UIC Wellness Center provides many resources for helping find housing, food, and clothing for students who may be having difficulty. U&I Cares can also provide resources and advocacy for students experiencing housing instability through the Office of the Dean of Students and The Hope Center.  If you or someone you care about is experiencing housing instability, you are not alone.
