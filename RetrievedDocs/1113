Each presentation will be assigned several judges who will visit during the judging period to listen to your presentation, view your poster/visual, and ask some questions about your project.
Be prepared to speak to a wide academic audience and answer questions!


Keep an eye out for informational tables hosted by various academic and administrative units across campus. The tables will be set up in the hallway just outside the presentation space.

3:30pm | Student Presentations & Judging Ends

Student presentations will end, and judges will have some time to submit their final scores.
Use this short break to grab a drink of water, use the restroom, or even stop by another student’s presentation (time allowing).

3:45pm | Keynote Address & Awards Ceremony

Come together with your peers and other attendees in the main hall for a keynote address from Dr. Cynthia Blair and awards for top scoring presentations in the following categories:

Honors Capstone

During these presentations you can use the provided paper scorecards to take notes and to reference when you submit your final scores later.
Presentations should be tailored for a general academic audience and therefore it is expected that you may be assigned one or more presentations in an area outside of your field.


After you have reviewed all of your assigned presentations, feel free to view others and connect with other faculty, staff, alumni and students in attendance, but be sure to submit your final scores no later than 3:45pm. You can use the link provided on the paper scorecards to access the electronic scorecard.

                            Abstract Writing Resources & Guidelines

                            Poster Printing Resources & Guidelines
                    








            General Poster Creation Guidelines
          


48”x36” recommended, matte required (not glossy or fabric), in horizontal (landscape) format.
General font size recommendations: Title=60pt, Author’s Name=48pt, Headers=36pt, Text=24-30pt. Helvetica or Arial fonts work well for legibility.
Use simple fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman.
Posters should be legible at 3 to 4 feet away and the project title should be legible from at least 6 feet away from the poster.
There must be a minimum of a 3/4-inch border around the outside of the poster.
Photos, graphics, illustrations, graphs, and tables add visual interest to posters.
If using an image from another source, it must either be licensed, or you must have written permission granting you use of the image by the creator. High-quality images work best since low-resolution images don’t reproduce well.
Avoid using dark backgrounds behind your body text; dark backgrounds can sometimes work well for presentations on computers (e.g., PowerPoint files), but they generally do not work well for printed text. Dark backgrounds behind titles on printed posters, on the other hand, may be acceptable since titles should be in bold font.
Make sure that your formatting is consistent throughout the poster. For example, if you have an extra line break below one section title, make sure the same spacing is used below other section titles.

Learn more about crafting a poster with the Poster Design & Presentation Video Workshop presented by the UIC Honors College.
