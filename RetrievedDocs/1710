How to structure a professional email











            Following up with recruiters on Linkedin
          Heading link

Sometimes it is hard to find the right person to follow up with at an employer you have submitted your resume to. This is where LinkedIn becomes a big help. You can find recruiters or hiring professionals who work at your target company and send them a follow-up message after you apply. As in all types of follow-up there is a proper approach to take in order to generate a response.


      Send a follow-up message
    













            Connect with UIC Alumni on LinkedIn
          Heading link



 
Copy link



You will not always be able to connect with recruiters or hiring personnel from the company you applied to.  Thankfully, UIC has a network of 150,000 alumni profiles on LinkedIn. Some of these alumni may work at organizations where you would like to become an intern or full-time employee. UIC alumni can be a great way to network your way into a company, before a job is even posted.
