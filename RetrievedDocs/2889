Unlike at some universities, where they might be separated out into different departments, at UIC the Mathematics, Mathematical Computer Science, Statistics, and Teaching of Mathematics programs are all grouped together in one department.  This arrangement allows easy collaboration between research groups and allows makes our department an excellent home for researchers and students whose interests span multiple disciplines.  See the program pages for more information on the different areas of concentration within our department.
