An annual comprehensive eye examination is covered under your CampusCare Benefits. At the end of your comprehensive examination, the physician will provide a prescription for eyeglasses if you have a need for vision correction.
Please note: A contact lens examination and fitting is an additional fee. Prescriptions for contact lenses can only be given after the physician performs this exam.  The fee associated with these fittings is not covered under your CampusCare benefits and will require payment at time of service. The fee amount varies based on the type of contact lens being fit and if you require instruction for insertion and removal.
Please notify the receptionist upon booking your appointment if you’re requesting both the comprehensive eye exam and the contact lens/eye glass fitting. A copy of your contact lens/eye glass prescription will be provided after this examination to purchase your contact lenses/glasses.
