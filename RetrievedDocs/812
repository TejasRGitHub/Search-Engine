Printing
Wepa is the university-wide print solution that enables users to send print jobs from their laptop or phone, or from a computer lab, and print at any Wepa print station. Wepa is a cloud-based system that offers integrations with Blackboard, Google Drive, and more. With over 70 stations installed across the university, printing is never far away.
