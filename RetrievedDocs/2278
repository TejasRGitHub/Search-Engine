Break Through Tech Chicago. I am the academic lead and grant PI.
I also am a proud BRAID department head.
To be released in October 2021 by Cambridge University Press: The Privacy Fix: How To Preserve Privacy in the Onslaught of Surveillance, coauthored by Richard Warner and me.
My 2019 book with Richard Warner: Why Don’t We Defend Better?: Data Breaches, Risk Management, and Public Policy.
And our earlier book from 2013: Unauthorized Access: The Crisis in Online Privacy and Security, CRC Press.
You should study Computer Science, and I’m writing about it. Download and read “Why Computer Science?” (in a collection, written just before enrollments went from high to extraordinarily high).
