            Gift Days
          

A gift day is a paid day (use of benefit time is not required) provided to leave benefit eligible employees. Essential employees who must work on a designated gift day may use their gift day at a later time in the current fiscal year, with supervisor approval. Unused gift days are not paid out at the time of termination and do not roll over into the next fiscal year.




            Reduced Service Days
          

Most non-essential university units are closed on the reduced service days. Leave benefit eligible employees may use accrued vacation leave or floating holidays to be paid on a reduced service day. Non-exempt civil service staff may also take as unpaid or use accrued comp time. Exempt employees without accrued vacation or floating holiday leave cannot take as unpaid.




            Floating Holidays
          

Floating holidays (2 or 4) are “designated holidays” by the president and chancellors. They must be taken in full day increments and must be used in the fiscal year. Unused floating holidays are not paid out at the time of termination and do not roll over into the next fiscal year.




            Juneteenth Holiday
          

While eligible faculty and staff will receive paid holiday time on the Juneteenth holiday, the University of Illinois System never fully closes and essential operations will continue. Holiday usage and pay policies will apply, as they do for other designated holidays.
