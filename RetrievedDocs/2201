As a parent to a UIC student, we recognize the importance of providing accurate and thorough information about the many ways in which we can support your student. Health Insurance can be daunting, very confusing and scary at times.  We are here to help each and every student feel knowledgeable, comfortable and empowered with their CampusCare coverage.
Our staff is dedicated to ensuring your student knows exactly what their Student Health Insurance is, how it works and the many ways in which it benefits them.  We serve as their on-campus advocates for their healthcare needs. CampusCare sends emails to every email address on file in a student’s MyUIC account. If you wish to receive CampusCare’s reminder emails, please have your student submit your email address in their MyUIC account.
While we are happy to discuss general CampusCare questions with parents, we are unable to discuss specific account information with anyone other than the student. If a student wishes for our office to speak directly with their parent, a signed FERPA must be on file with the University.
