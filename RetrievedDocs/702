On September 6, 2022, UI Health was pleased to welcome U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) at its Mile Square Health Center to lead a roundtable discussion about the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Along with Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Duckworth was instrumental in securing key health equity provisions in the IRA, perhaps most importantly the reduction of prescription drug costs by capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin for Medicare beneficiaries and capping annual drug costs for Medicare seniors. Other provisions in the IRA will promote environmental justice for poor and marginalized communities by remediating air pollution, mitigating health risks from extreme heat, and reducing indoor toxins.
Dr. Robert A. Barish, UIC Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs, introduced the senator and commenced the roundtable discussion, which was moderated by Garth Reynolds, executive director of the Illinois Pharmacists Association (IPhA). The other assembled panelists brought a variety of needed perspectives on issues of prescription drug costs and access to healthcare:

Amber Kirchhoff, director of state policy, Illinois Primary Health Care Association
David Ernesto Munar, president and CEO, Howard Brown Health
Dr. Nicole Gastala, director of behavioral health & research, UI Health Mile Square Health Center
Sandra Durley, senior associate director of ambulatory care pharmacies, UI Health; clinical asst. professor of pharmacy practice, UIC College of Pharmacy
Megan Murtagh, pharmacy student representative, UIC College of Pharmacy
Carol Gyimatey, patient experience and member of the UI Health Mile Square Health Center Board of Directors
Philippe Largent, state director, AARP IL
Emily Wetherholt, IPhA Region 2 (Cook County) director and member of IPhA Board of Directors

Senator Duckworth spoke passionately about her work in passing the IRA, and the importance of its various provisions for promoting health equity. “Every time I hear from an Illinoisan who is facing the unbearable decision of either paying for their lifesaving prescription drugs or paying for rent, the same frustrating question comes to mind: How are we still allowing Big Pharma to have such a stranglehold on our country?” she said. “So, it is important seniors and Black and Brown Chicagoans know that Senate Democrats passed historic changes that will lower prescription drug costs for millions across the country.”
“Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is an important step forward to ensure seniors and other vulnerable populations have access to the prescription drugs they need to maintain health and well-being,” said Dr. Barish. “UI Health is dedicated to ensuring access to affordable and high-quality care, so we couldn’t be happier to host this roundtable and to have Senator Duckworth here to speak about this achievement.”
