Portal New Version
New Admits Spring 2022 and Later
Continuing Students, Faculty and Staff Only
Login
Welcome to the new upgraded version of my.uic.edu. There are many new features. The portal is more personalized to your role at the university. The system will provide a better experience. Remember, you can still customize the new version of the portal. Please take some to explore the videos to navigate and utilize the portal features.
Welcome to UIC! Once you activate your UIC NetID and password, use it to access most authenticated University of Illinois computing and networking services (e.g., Self-Service Enterprise applications like Student Registration & Records, Financial Aid) as well as UIC campus-based services like email, Blackboard, Wifi and computer labs.
One NetID. One Password. Your new NetID is a unique identifier assigned to you. It becomes part of your UIC email address (NetID@uic.edu) and is your login name for these services.
A secure and well-managed password is key to protecting your access to University of Illinois computing resources. The activation process includes setting up password recovery options for self-service management so that you will be prepared, in advance, if you need to recover your password.

First Time User: Activate your NetId
Are you a new UIC employee? You will create your NetID and password in UI New Hire.
Already have a UIC NetID and password? Go to: password.uic.edu
