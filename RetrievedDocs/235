About

Research Interests:
I study how to improve belongingness in the computer science classroom.  I do this by looking at assessment design and other classroom strategies.  I am also currently investigating the use of a one-time story telling intervention to help with CS retention.  In addition to belongingness, I am also studying how students problem solve.  I am investigating ways to improve students confidence in problem solving.
