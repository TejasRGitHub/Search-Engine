Sara Riazi joined the computer science department as a clinical assistant professor this semester. Her research interests are graph mining, data science, and big data analysis.
This semester, Riazi is teaching two sections of CS 141, Program Design II.
“UIC is a great public school and seeing how the educators here care about the students is amazing,” Riazi said. “I enjoy being a member of such a wonderful community.”
Most recently, Riazi served as a visiting assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Prior to that, she worked as an assistant professor at the University of New Haven, Connecticut, and was a graduate research fellow at the University of Oregon. She also worked as a software engineer for a web design, ecommerce consulting, and digital marketing firm in Tehran, Iran.
Riazi received her bachelor’s degree in software engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, and her master’s degree and her PhD in computer science from the University of Oregon.
“My focus is big data and data science, and I want to prepare our students in this area to be able to continue their career in this competitive field,” Riazi said.
