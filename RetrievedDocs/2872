            instructions
          

1.  Please complete your Web Time entry (online timesheet), inputting the number of hours worked during the current pay period for the correct job title. See chart below for pay-period beginning and ending dates, as well as timesheet submission deadlines and pay dates.
To complete your Web Time entry, please log in to https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/ and follow these steps:

Select University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and log in with your usual NetID and password.
Once you are logged in, select the “Employee” tab in the top left corner. Once selected, click “Time Sheet” and select the position that you are submitting hours for. Click “Timesheet” again to access your Web Time entry.
Once you are in your Web Time entry, please input the hours that you have worked throughout the two week pay period under the Earning category called “Regular Pay.” Important: enter your hours for the first week of the pay period, and then select “Next” to enter your hours for the second week of pay period.
If the submission deadline has passed, the system will not allow you to input your hours online. In this case, you must fill out a Late Time Report Form, found in the Forms and Helpful Links section of this page.

This process will delay your payment, so please make every effort to submit online before the deadline.



2.  Once complete, please click “Submit”. After you have completed your Web Time entry and submitted it online, please provide the Web Time entry summary to your supervisor for approval. Please make sure the following is included in the Web Time entry summary:

First and last name
Position title
Hours entered throughout the two week pay period

3.  Please either email this to your supervisor once completed or provide a hard copy for their signature. Please discuss with your supervisor in advance whether the online or hard-copy option is preferred.
Note for supervisors who prefer email approvals: Please either electronically sign the Web Time entry summary or email bmejobs@uic.edu stating your approval with the attached Web Time entry summary.
4.  You must submit your Web Time entry and receive approval from your direct supervisor by the date listed in the “Approved Timesheet due by 5pm” column of the chart. Your Web Time entry will not be approved unless the department receives approval from your direct supervisor by this deadline.







                            Important notes
                    








            .
          

1.  The department staff is not responsible for collecting signatures from your direct supervisor for your Web Time entry.
2.  If you are trying to submit hours for a previous pay period after deadline has elapsed, the Web Time entry will not allow you to enter your hours. Therefore, you will need to complete a Late Time Report Form and enter your hours on this form. Please note that you will need to complete the same steps in obtaining your supervisor’s approval for this late-report form that you typically follow with your Web Time entry. The unit will manually enter your hours in the system on your behalf once the Late Time Report Form has been signed and completed.
3.  If you incorrectly submit your hours on Web Time entry, please contact bmejobs@uic.edu. Your Web Time entry can be returned to you for correction.
4.  Do not submit more hours than what was listed on your contract. If you feel that you need to work extra hours, please consult with your supervisor and obtain advance approval from the HR coordinator before you work the additional hours.
Any questions or concerns? Please contact bmejobs@uic.edu or (312) 996-2335.

            Pay questions
          


Where can I find my earnings statement?

Log in to this site to view your earnings statements.


How do I view/change my direct deposit details?

Visit this page to view and edit your direct deposit information. 


Is my pay considered taxable income?

Yes, income received from UIC is taxable.


I missed the time-sheet deadline, but I submitted a Late Time Report Form. When will I get paid?

 It takes up to 1.5 weeks to process the payments for late time report submissions, so you should receive your pay two weeks after your form is submitted.



For other pay-related questions, please visit the UIC HR Pay Services site.






            Other HR questions
          


 I do not remember my UIN. Is there a place I can look it up?

Find your UIN here.
Note: Not everyone has or needs a UIN. If you were affiliated with any University of Illinois location before 1996, it’s possible you weren’t issued a UIN. If you never had a UIN, you don’t need one to order transcripts.
