If you are a CampusCare member and have health insurance coverage through another health benefit plan besides CampusCare, you must provide information on both health plans at the time of registration at a healthcare provider, scheduling an appointment, and at the time of your appointment. CampusCare is considered a secondary payer to all health insurance plans automatically, except in the case a member has Medicaid/public aid, then CampusCare will be the primary payer.
In all cases CampusCare will only provide payment for covered services as defined in the CampusCare Certificate of Coverage.
