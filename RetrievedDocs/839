Educational Technology (EdTech) refers to the systems and tools that support the teaching and learning process. Teaching with technology is a broad topic that includes the use of EdTech and involves different media types (e.g., video, audio, text) and delivery modes (e.g., online, on-campus, hybrid)
CATE centrally manages educational technologies available to all UIC instructors, teaching assistants, and students. These enterprise-level technologies allow instructors to manage, share, and develop course materials, and facilitate students learning through communication and collaboration technologies.
