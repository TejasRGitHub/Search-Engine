This program has been an amazing opportunity. It consists of some of the best faculty members and professors, and I have such a loving and supportive cohort of peers. I’ve gotten close to many of my professors, and I was even offered the chance to participate in one of my professor’s research teams. The people I’ve met in this program are like family to me.

Krista Jones
DNP ’11, MS ’09, MSN ’07, APRN
A member of the UIC Nursing-Urbana faculty since 2007, Krista Jones was appointed director of the campus in 2016.
Beyond her administrative role, Jones is a productive researcher and esteemed educator. Her research interests include the development, implementation and evaluation of social-networking interventions to reduce risky behaviors and promote health, with a particular focus on adolescent and young adult populations.
In April 2015, she was recognized by her peers with two New Investigator Awards from the Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS) Adolescent Health Section and the MNRS Public Health Section.
Jones is also a clinical associate professor admired as much by her students as her peers. In May 2014, she was selected by undergraduate seniors to receive the UIC Silver Circle Award for Teaching Excellence.
