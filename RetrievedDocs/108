Data Science Major

Data science — the ability to organize, process, and derive insight from enormous amounts of information — draws from a variety of skill sets. Data scientists are trained in computing. They’re also experts in statistics. They understand how their work influences the business world, from corporations to government agencies. And they have the ability to take the complex work they do and explain it to all audiences, making them excellent communicators.
To make sure each UIC data science major is prepared to excel at all of these tasks, we tapped into the expertise of three UIC colleges for the program’s core courses: the College of Engineering (home to the computer science department), the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (which houses math, statistics, and communication), and the College of Business. Two more colleges, the College of Applied Health Sciences and the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, contribute to our specialized data-science concentrations.
Together, we will teach you how to do highly important work that is often highly compensated: developing methods to comb through huge repositories of data, unearthing the nuggets of meaningful information that can help businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations to chart the best course.
One of the great advantages of data science is that you can apply its skills to any field or industry that interests you. Data science approaches are relevant in health care, computing, information technology, urban planning, retail, marketing, manufacturing, transportation, communication, education, insurance, finance, science, security, law enforcement, and more. Data science at UIC is a multidisciplinary major that builds a strong foundation and gives you the option to specialize in a field of your choice (see our nine concentrations below).
The data science major is outlined in detail in the UIC course catalog. The content below provides an overview.

Why consider the data science major? Do you want to help your community, improve healthcare, or design the next generation of AI-powered systems? UIC’s data science curriculum will equip you with the statistical and computational background necessary to tackle the most pressing problems of our times. The best part is that the problems you choose to work on can be as diverse as your background and interests.



  Elena Zheleva, PhD
  
               | 
              
  Assistant Professor, Computer Science
  








Data science is code speak for the future. It is a way for understanding how technologies reproduce and reinforce social injustices and, at the same time, re-deploying technologies to help reimagine our world. Data organize our world in categories that underscore how we connect as human beings but also how we may drift apart, fostering cultures of marginalization, misinformation, and algorithmic bias.
If you want to unlock technology and use it to make the world better, this is the degree for you.



  Zizi Papacharissi, PhD
  
               | 
              
  Professor and Department Head, Communication; Professor, Political Science
  








In the past decade, advances in the way data can be generated, collected, stored, and disseminated have resulted in an exponential growth of data. This has led to an increasing demand for skilled professionals in the field of data science who can analyze and extract insights from this data. UIC’s new data science major will provide students with a solid foundation in computer science, information and decision sciences, and statistics, and will position them to succeed in this rapidly-growing field.



  Gonzalo A. Bello, PhD
  
               | 
              
  Clinical Assistant Professor, Computer Science
  








The demand for data analytics and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare is growing rapidly.  Predictive analytics provides decision support to caregivers to improve the accuracy of diagnoses for individual patients, as well as defining patterns in populations. Understanding how to predict those at risk for certain disease conditions and recommend lifestyle changes to improve overall wellness is important to us all. Artificial intelligence can assist clinicians with complex data interpretation of digital images and improve quality of life for patients with severe brain injuries. UIC’s health data science concentration will show you how data is used in healthcare.
