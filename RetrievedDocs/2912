The Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) offers
undergraduate degrees in

Mathematics
Mathematics and Computer Science
Mathematics Teaching
Statistics

Each of these programs has a mathematical core, is multidisciplinary in scope, and provides our students with a wide variety of career opportunities upon graduation. Our graduates continue with graduate work in mathematics, statistics, computer science; do graduate work in fields such as mathematics education (both research and teaching), economics, and public health; become secondary math teachers; go on to medical school, business school, and law school; and pursue careers in business, finance, actuarial science, informatics, public health, and government. Other MSCS graduates take with them their love of mathematics, their strong analytical and creative skills, and their participatory experiences in an undergraduate major that's rich with ideas into myriad new careers and pursuits, such as recording engineer, start-up entrepreneur, and educational software developer.

            College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Initiative
          Heading link



 
Copy link



The LAS Undergraduate Research Initiative (LASURI)Â is a well-funded College of Liberal Arts and Sciences program that pairs Undergraduate Research Assistants with Faculty Mentors and gives these researchers or research teams funding to conduct semester- or year-long research projects.
If selected, Undergraduate Research Assistants receive a \$2500 award (\$1250 per semester), and Faculty Mentors receive a \$1500 grant for project costs.
If you are already working with an MSCS professor on an ongoing research project, then you are strongly encouraged to apply for a LASURI award. If you are an MSCS undergraduate taking a 300- or 400-level course, especially a 400-level elective (like MATH 494, MCS 421, MCS 481, or an independent study), then you are especially encouraged to approach one of your professors about designing an undergraduate research project and applying for a LASURI research award.
For more information about awards and scholarships, contact your MSCS advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Studies.






            Summer and Academic Year Undergraduate Research Opportunities
          Heading link



 
Copy link



The American Mathematical Society maintains a list of current Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates in mathematics.
UIC provides its own Undergraduate Research Experiences. This website includes a partial list of MSCS faculty interested in taking on undergraduate students.
UREs are arranged with a faculty member and generally take place during the academic year. (See also the entry on LASURI above.)
For more information about undergraduate research experiences (REUs or UREs), contact your MSCS advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Studies.






            MSCS Advising
          Heading link



 
Copy link



Advising is one of the most important services provided by the Department. Departmental advisors can offer guidance about the major and courses going beyond the descriptive information available in the undergraduate catalog. Departmental advisors in MSCS offer both drop-in advising (i.e., appointments for quick questions of 15 minutes or less) and full advising appointment (i.e., appointments for course planning, career development, and departmental inquires of 30 minutes). Students can find drop-in advising information on the LAS Advising homepage or on iAdvise (my.uic.edu).






            ALEKS Placement for Math Courses
          Heading link



 
Copy link



All incoming first-year students must complete an online math assessment using ALEKS prior to taking other required UIC placement tests on campus and attending Orientation and Registration. Read more in the revised UIC Math Placement Procedures, and the ALEKS flyer.






            Tips on Applying to Graduate School

If you are a junior or a senior considering continuing your education to obtain a Masters or Doctorate Degree, or if you are a new MSCS major curious about careers in Mathematics, Statistics and related fields, then we have a new must-read resource for you. Check out MSCS Careers page, along with our new Preparing for Graduate School and Careers in Mathematics brochures.
