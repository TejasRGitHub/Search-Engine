UIC Degree and Certificate Programs
UIC Degree and Certificate Programs
UIC offers a variety of certificate programs (both credit and non-credit) and degree programs to help working professionals develop knowledge and skills to advance their careers.
UIC's online programs combine the academic excellence of UIC's on-campus programs with the flexibility of any-time access to learning, including: lessons, coursework, and class participation. All of UIC's online programs meet the same requirements for academic quality as our on-campus programs.
Course credit from Stackable Certificate Programs can be applied to an affiliated Master's program. Stackable certificate programs can be online, on-campus, or a blend of online and on-campus.
Credit Course Sequences are groups of courses in select professional areas that, taken together, can be applied toward an Illinois State Board of Education approval or endorsement, or can be applied toward other professional credentials.
Our current certificate programs and degree programs are listed below by field.
