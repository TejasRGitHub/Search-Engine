Student Illnesses Protocol






Communicable Illnesses Notification Protocol 
Identification

Identification of a student with a communicable illness is typically disclosed to the campus in one of the following ways:

Self-reported, either to the University or Hospital
Department of Public Health (city, county or state)
Hospital or Outpatient Care Center diagnosis (Family Medicine, UI Hospital Emergency Room, Infection Control, UI Hospital Microbiology Laboratory or other clinic)


If the case is diagnosed at UI Hospital, Infection Control or the microbiology laboratory will notify Department(s) of Public Health.
If the case is confirmed by a Department of Public Health, they file a case report and conduct an investigation. During the investigation, once it is disclosed to the University that the individual is a UIC student, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (OVCSA) will notify Infection Control at UI Hospital.
In addition, there may be Hospital cases or community activity that would require notification to UIC students for possible screening, prevention, evaluation or treatment.

 
Notification

Confirmed or probable cases of communicable diseases may require a notification alert from the campus to students, employees, residence halls, etc. depending on the severity of the organism, the nature of the exposure and outbreak concerns.
These notifications can include notification of possible exposure, instructions to be evaluated with testing or treatment, prevention measures to avoid exposure, education about signs and symptoms, or education about self-treatment if applicable.
Suspected cases will not usually activate the full protocol until the illness is confirmed. However, based on probability of the diagnosis, severity of the disease and risk of transmission there may be notification in some cases without confirmation.

 
Examples of Communicable Diseases

Pertussis
Meningitis (Neisseria meningitides is the organism of concern most likely to occur in student populations)
Tuberculosis
Chicken Pox
Other emerging diseases (e.g. SARS, swine flu)
There are other communicable diseases that are not reportable to the Department of Public Health, but may invoke this notification protocol if there is concern for an outbreak on the campus or within the Hospital. Examples include:

Influenza-like illnesses
Norovirus or other gastrointestinal illnesses



 
Cases Reported to UIC from Department(s) of Public Health (city, county or state)

If necessary, OVCSA convenes a meeting with staff from Infection Control, Family Medicine, University Health Service, Environmental Health & Safety, Public Affairs, UIC Police; the student’s college; and Campus Housing (if relevant)
