UI Health is pleased to be a partner in the new Auburn-Gresham Healthy Lifestyle Hub. Spearheaded by the Greater Auburn Gresham Development Corporation, the project has breathed new life into a long-vacant building that is now a center for the promotion of health and wellness in the community. The hub is a neighborhood destination for medical care, healthy food, banking, legal aid, and educational resources, and it will contribute to revitalizing the neighborhood and promoting health equity for its residents.
Anchoring the hub is the UI Health Mile Square Primary and Immediate Care Center, which fills a gap in available care by providing adult and pediatric primary care, women’s health care, pregnancy and prenatal care, behavioral health and substance use disorder care, HIV care, dental care, and preventative care. Pharmacy services are also available onsite. The hub houses a UIC Neighborhood Center which, with the Chicago Bears Community Room and Teaching Kitchen, provides resources for healthy eating as well as academic resources, and workshops for small businesses and local entrepreneurs.
The Auburn-Gresham Healthy Lifestyle Hub was formally inaugurated with a ribbon cutting ceremony on October 7, 2022. University of Illinois System President Timothy Killeen and UIC Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs Dr. Robert A. Barish were among those who spoke at the event. “It’s my pleasure to celebrate another milestone for the Auburn-Gresham community and to thank all of the people who made this happen. It is amazing what this partnership has accomplished and when you see this new facility, I think you’ll agree that it is magnificent,” said Dr. Barish. “UI Health is dedicated to the pursuit of health equity by increasing access to affordable and high-quality care for all our patients, and our network of Mile Square Health Centers have a fifty-year history of collaboration with communities to provide accessible and equitable services. With this facility we will now expand that care to Auburn-Gresham.”
