Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).
My research interests primarily lie in computer networks, specifically in datacenters and low-latency networks, software-defined networking, and network hardware. I have secondary interests in architecture and hardware design.
I received my Ph.D. from Purdue University in August 2015. I spent the summer and fall of 2012 at Google on datacenter congestion control and load balancing. I worked as a senior design designer at Nvidia between 2004 and 2008 when I designed the memory controller for the first unibody MacBook Air (see this this newspaper clip!). I got my bachelorâ€™s degree from BITS, Pilani (India).
Aside from research and teaching, I enjoy playing tennis and reading books. I live in Chicago with my wife Bhairavi Swaminathan. Bhairavi is a researcher at UIC and her work is in molecular biology and genetics.
I maintain a code repository as well as a LinkedIn page.
