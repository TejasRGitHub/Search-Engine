Important Announcements & Adjustments, due to COVID-19:
FSL Staff Advisors will be working in-person on-campus for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters.  
Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL) Offices in 340 Student Center East (SCE) are open weekdays, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm (CST), with FSL advising staff available for appointments — and via email, phone, Zoom, and other pre-arranged teleconferencing. Individual one-on-one appointments with staff should first be arranged in a virtual manner to permit physical distancing within indoor spaces.
Please visit our FSL Staff Contacts page to locate email/phone contacts, to arrange a Zoom or other virtual meeting, & to verify staffing schedules and availability.
If you make a physical visit to 340 Student Center East (3 South), please note that it is now optional for visitors to wear a mask/face covering. (Individual staff may ask a visitor to wear a mask/face covering in order to enter a private office).
