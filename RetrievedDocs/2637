Art on theMART provides a public platform for moving image work by renowned local, national and international multi-disciplinary artists. The program is the result of a 30-year commitment by theMART owner Vornado Realty Trust, in close collaboration with the City of Chicago, with the shared goal to provide public access to innovative contemporary artwork for the thousands of visitors traversing the Chicago Riverwalk each day.
