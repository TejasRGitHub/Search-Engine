Copy link



If you missed the deadline to waive out, add/drop dependents or continue through the Summer for CampusCare coverage AND there are any extenuating/unusual circumstances, you can submit an official Letter of Appeal explaining why the deadline was missed along with the following documentation:
Your First and Last Name
Your UIN#
Full Mailing Address
Copy of the Front and Back of your Health Insurance Card
Explanation for missing the deadline date
This information should be sent via Email to cchealth@uic.edu
Please allow 2 weeks for a decision. A letter will be mailed to the address provided on your application. Please note that appeals can be approved or denied based on the Committee’s decision.
PLEASE NOTE THAT CAMPUSCARE CANNOT ACCEPT APPEALS FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN THE STUDENT
CampusCare sends out 2 emails, to every email address the University has on file, for all registered students before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date every semester containing instructions on how to locate and submit the forms. CampusCare also speaks at all new/transfer student, parent, and college orientations regarding this information. Students who do not have extenuating/unusual circumstances will not receive an approved appeal. Being new to this school, not reading/opening your emails, or forgetting to fill out the form before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date are not extenuating or unusual circumstances and will not receive approval of their appeal.
Students who register late after the CampusCare Enrollment Period Deadline Date have 14 days from their effective date to waive coverage or add existing Dependents.
The effective date of coverage is the date on which the late registration is entered and processed in the student records system by the Office of Records and Registration.
