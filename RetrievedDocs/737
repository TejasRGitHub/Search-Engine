Whether you are just beginning at UIC or are back for your final semester, the transition from summer to fall can be a difficult adjustment. Starting the year can bring a mix of emotions. You might feel excitement, but also some feelings of loneliness or anxiety about what’s ahead. Take some time to look into the various success units that UIC has to offer such as Peer Success Coaching or the Office of First Year Initiatives. It’s important to start off with a good self-care routine, which includes healthy eating, exercise, and healthy stress management.  Find resources that can support your mental health during this transition at the UIC Wellness Center The UIC Counseling Center, UIC InTouch Crisis & Support Hotline, and the Office of the Dean of Students are also here to help you. Finally, try to find small ways to start the year off right – just a bit of exercise, stretching, talking to supportive friends, and a few nutritious meals a week—can all add up to healthy and successful semester!
