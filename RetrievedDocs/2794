UIC Business Alumni & Community

A UIC Business degree is more than a credential, it is the background and preparation that gave you the opportunity to have an impact in your profession, community, and beyond. In its half century of existence, our college has grown from three programs to a top-ranked, research-based business school with an international reputation. We have built highly regarded departments in all areas and continue to be recognized by the business community for our outstanding graduates.
We are UIC Business because of you and your support!
