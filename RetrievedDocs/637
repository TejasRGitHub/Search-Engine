Alumni may borrow materials from the UIC Library, with some limitations.
Getting your card

Please fill out the form below.
Your card will be mailed to the address you provide.
You will be able to borrow items once you have received the card.
If you intend to visit from out of town, please contact us in advance to clarify which privileges may be extended to you.  Please email lib-desk@uic.edu or call (312) 996-2724.

Please double check your address in your application.  If your card is returned to us as undeliverable, you may not be eligible to reapply.
Renewing your card

Your card is good for a lifetime, but you will need to update your address and contact information periodically.
Bring your Alumni Borrowing card and current photo ID when you come to the library to borrow materials.

Your card responsibilities

You are expected to update your card if your mailing or email address changes and show proof of identity and address.
Your card can only be used at the Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago, the Richard J. Daley Library, and the John Marshall Law School Library.
You may be billed for overdue or lost items and your library borrowing privileges will be suspended for failure to adhere to Library policies.
