            What Service Might Be Right for Me?
          Heading link

It’s okay if you’re not sure what service will help you the most – an initial consultation counselor can help you with that! But if you’d like to get an idea, these questions can help.





                            Do I need coping skills or a space to process my thoughts and feelings?
                    








            Coping vs Processing

            Goal-Directed vs. Open-Ended
          




            Goal-Directed

                            Could medication be right for me?
                    








            Psychiatry
          

Your initial consultation counselor might recommend that you consult with a psychiatrist, who can help you learn about and manage your medication options.

                            Am I looking for support on an as-needed basis or a regular weekly commitment?

                            Do I work best on my own, one-on-one, or in groups?
                    








            Number of People Involved
          




            On My Own

                            Would I benefit from a longer-term connection to a therapist?
                    








            Longer-Term Treatment Options
          

Some students benefit from connecting with a therapist who providers longer-term or more open-ended services than we do. If you are looking to establish a longer-term relationship, we can help you find the right fit outside of UIC.
