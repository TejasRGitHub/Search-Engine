Eligibility: All currently-enrolled UIC students.
More Information: Whether it’s the daily challenges of being a college student, the impact of living through a pandemic and political unrest, or you’re just having an off day and want someone to talk to, we’re here for you. Drop in when you need it or come weekly to get the mood boost you need to get you through your day.
*Though you are not committed to attending every week and may "drop in" on whatever week(s) work for you, we do require registration so that we can ensure that these safe spaces are attended by UIC students only.*
*Please note that there will be no meeting on Wednesday, November 9th*
