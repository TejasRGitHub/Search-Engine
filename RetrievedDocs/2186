The Health Service Fee is a mandatory fee that is charged along with a student’s tuition. The Health Service Fee is NOT part of the CampusCare program, but works in conjunction to provide comprehensive medical coverage to our students.

Family Medicine        Ph: 312-996-2901
Counseling Center    Ph: 312-996-3490
