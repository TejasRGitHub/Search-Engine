            Alumni Affinity Networks
          




Alumni affinity networks assist in organizing and connecting alumni to their closest affinity to UIC. Affinity is defined as a group that alumni are most closely linked to by common interest or purpose (e.g. geography, college, unit, athletic team or affinity—Greek life, employees, cultural, ethnic, veterans, etc.). Being involved in an alumni affinity network is a rewarding way to stay connected to friends and colleagues while having an impact on UIC students and alumni.  Learn more by contacting uicalumni@uic.edu.

Umoja: Black Legacy Alumni Coalition is an affinity network that engages Black alumni of UIC. Umoja, which means “unity” in Swahili, aims to provide networking and community to UIC alumni, support student recruitment and retention, honor history and build traditions. If you are interested in getting involved with Umoja, please contact uicalumni@uic.edu.
