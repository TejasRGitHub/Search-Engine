There are various forms of coaching, and at UIC, the Academic Center for Excellence houses three specific methods of coaching:
 

Transition Coaching: Coaches dedicated to the support of the transition from high school to college, to help the first-year student become confident, well-informed decision makers
Peer Success Coaching: Upper-class students who are expertly trained to help their peers navigate challenges and provide support when needed.
Academic Coaching: Learn how to study better, manage your time, and succeed in the classroom with essential academic skills

Success Coaching can help you with:



Increased Confidence
Goal attainment
Decreased anxiety
Resilience

Coaches use an asset-based approach and can help you identify your own learning strengths, and work to develop goals based upon those strengths.
