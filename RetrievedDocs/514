If you require specific assistance from library staff in order to safely navigate the library during the pandemic, please inform us ahead of time by emailing lib-ref@uic.edu with desired assistance. Some examples include:

If you read lips and need staff members to wear a clear mask to facilitate communication.
If you need priority access to an elevator for mobility purposes.
If you require a staff member to escort you to an accessible computer or table.

We recognize that not everyone may be able to come to the library due to accessibility issues. We will do what we can to help you access library services through low contact pickup or remote services. Please contact lib-ref@uic.edu to inquire about potential services.

In the Library of the Health Sciences, the third floor is the designated quiet floor. Note: There is usually also a large quiet enclosed reading room (107) on the first floor, but this is temporarily unavailable.

If you have an accommodation and need to reserve a space at the Daley library specifically for taking an online test, please contact the Disability Resource Center at least 72 hours prior. They will contact the library, and a library staff member will reserve a room on your behalf.

Service dogs are welcome in the UIC Library. Service dogs are trained to do specific tasks and must be under control at all times. For information about assistance animals, also known as therapy and emotional support animals see the UIC Service and Assistance Animal Policy.






            Emergency evacuation
          Heading link



 
Copy link



When elevators are not in service proceed to the designated Area of Rescue Assistance or nearest stairwell if you can and wait there to be evacuated by a member of the UIC Police Department (UICPD) or an emergency responder.
If possible, ask a member of the library staff or another person to accompany you to the stairwell. Ask the person to immediately inform UICPD and/or other emergency responders of your exact location (floor, stairwell number, etc.) once the person has evacuated.
Once in the stairwell, call UICPD (312-355-5555) for help; if no help arrives in 5-10 minutes, call again.






            Research Assistance
          Heading link



 
Copy link



Make an appointment with a librarian to discuss your research assignments and identify relevant resources. One option is to meet online, sharing a screen to walk through the search process together. To work in person with a librarian and a sign language interpreter, please use this form to request an interpreter. It is recommended that you allow one week’s notice for this.
You can also get help via our “Chat with a librarian” chat option, which displays at the bottom of every Library website window.
You can also send us an email using this form.
Other options to get help.






            Request books from the shelf

            Designate someone to check out books for you
          Heading link



 
Copy link

            Scanning library materials
          Heading link



 
Copy link



Students in need of alternate format of inaccessible library materials must first register with the Disability Resource Center (DRC), then fill out the Alternate Format Request Form. The DRC and the Library work collaboratively through this process to ensure students have equitable access to educational materials in a timely manner.
Faculty and staff who have requested and received an accommodation from the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) may place requests for materials by contacting their nearest ILL office using the relevant email address listed below.

Richard J. Daley Library: lib-ill@uic.edu
Library of the Health Sciences, Chicago: lib-lhsill@uic.edu
Library of the Health Sciences, Peoria: lib-pcir@uic.edu
Crawford Library of the Health Sciences, Rockford: lib-lhsr@uic.edu
Library of the Health Sciences, Urbana: lib-lhsu@uic.edu







            Interlibrary loan & OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
          Heading link



 
Copy link



If you would like articles or chapters that you request through ILLiad to be OCRed, please include a note in the notes field to that effect when you submit your request.
Please see Request Items for more on interlibrary loan.
You do not need to be registered with the DRC in order to make these requests.
While libraries may often notice and honor an OCR request, sometimes they may not, and since fulfilled requests are automatically uploaded into our system and notifications are triggered without manual intervention we do not have an opportunity to intervene prior to your receiving the requested item. However, if you find that your requested item has not been OCRed, please alert us by responding to the email stating that your item is available and we can convert it to OCR-readable using Adobe Acrobat.






            Accessibility features of e-book platforms
          Heading link



 
Copy link



We now have detailed charts available that compare some of the different e-book platforms that we use at UIC, as well as their compatibility with JAWS and VoiceOver (scroll down on the page for the charts for JAWS and VoiceOver).
These charts, compiled in spring 2022, contain information for each e-book platform listed including keyboard-only navigation, ZoomText compatibility, Text-to-Speech compatibility, magnification and re-flowable text, contrast, font color, size and style, and distinction without color.
