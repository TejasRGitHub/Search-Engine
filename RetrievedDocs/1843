United Support Network Paraprofessional Training Program






United Support Network Paraprofessional Training Program
United Support Network (USN) is a community of students coming together to support each other through life’s challenges and connect around life experiences. The network provides weekly support groups for UIC students as well as monthly, fun, social, stress-busting events.
PSYC 386:  Crisis Counseling Techniques, which served as the training program for UIC Paraprofessional Counselors, is no longer being offered.  Assessment and planning is currently underway to determine how best to prepare student leaders and implement USN moving forward.
