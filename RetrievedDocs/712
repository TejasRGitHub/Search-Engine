The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recognized UI Health with three awards for its quality and commitment to providing effective care and treatment, using the most advanced procedures available. For the sixth year in a row, UI Health received the Honor Roll Elite Gold Plus award – the highest level of recognition from the AHA/ASA – for treatment of stroke, and for the fourth year in a row received the Gold Plus Quality Achievement award for treatment of heart failure. UI Health was additionally recognized with a Bronze Award for quality in resuscitation care.
The Institute of Medicine of Chicago awarded UI Health with a 2022 Innovation in Health Care / Health Care Delivery for its Better Health Through Housing program. Since its 2018 inception, the program has provided a pathway from the emergency room to permanent housing for hundreds of people who were experiencing homelessness.

          The award-winning design of the Surgical Innovation Training Lab
        


UIC’s Surgical Innovation Training Lab (SITL) won the Design for Adaptation and Transformation category at the 2022 European Healthcare Design Awards. Foundational to SITL’s innovative design is that the laboratory borrows from theater stage design to create a highly flexible and adaptable space for research and training in minimally invasive and robotic surgery, helping secure UI Health’s leadership in those techniques.
