                Asian American Resource and Cultural Center
              



















AARCC Fall Hours: Monday – Friday 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The Asian American Resource and Cultural Center, located at 723 W. Maxwell St, supports the needs of Asian Americans at UIC and offers social, cultural, and educational programs to those interested in expanding their knowledge about Asian Americans.
When you visit our center, masks are still mandatory at AARCC until further notice. Only in our Gallery space are masks recommended. We ask for folks to respect those who want to wear masks or socially distance from others.
To learn more about AARCC or our other programs, services, and events, please feel free to explore our website or read this message from the Director. You may also email us at AARCC@uic.edu and someone will respond as soon as possible.
If you have witnessed or have experienced anti-Asian violence or are interested in addressing anti-Asian bias, please consider using our Anti-Asian Bias Tools and Resources at https://aarcc.uic.edu/anti-asian-bias-tools-and-resources/.
