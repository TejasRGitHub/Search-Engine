Link to the data files for the three states used in the
paper are below. Each data is an EXCEL spreadsheet.
 
Explanations of various columns of the spreadsheet
 
Column 1: 
District: This
column identifies the district number of the county in column 3. 
 
Column 2:
County_id: Column 1 and column 2 together form an unique identifier for the counties in column 3. A county is identified by its County_id (column 2) and the District (column 1) it belongs
to. This was specifically needed to identify and differentiate the counties
that belonged to more than one district.
 
The software considers the counties belonging to different
districts as separate entities.
 
Column 3:
County: This
column contains the name of the county.
 
Column 4:
Republicans: This
contains the total number of votes in favor of the Republican party (GOP) in the county identified by column 1 and column
2.
 
Column 4:
Democrats: This
contains the total number of votes in favor of the Democratic party in the county identified by column 1 and column 2.
 
Column 5:
Neighbors: This
column contains information about the neighboring counties of the given county.
“Neighboring counties” represents the
counties that share a boundary with the county identified by column 1 and
column 2. Neighbors are separated by commas.
