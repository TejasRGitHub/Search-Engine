Policies


E-Scooters On-Campus






E-Scooters On-campus
By policy, UIC restricts the use of e-scooters and other low speed, motorized personal transportation devices on campus.
Enforcement:
Fall 2021: UIC PD officers will receive training from Centers for Diversity staff, led by Margaret Fink, Director, Disability Cultural Center, on tips for approaching students. Some students utilize non-traditional assistive devices, for example.
Spring semester 2022: For first month, no warnings will be given, only reminders and information. Thereafter, enforcement will include warnings as appropriate.
Compliance (starting Spring 2022):
Violation                             Code                                 Citation Amount
First Violation                     Warning Only                 $0.00
Second Violation              Mandatory Fine             $50.00
Third                                      Mandatory Fine             $75.00
Fourth                                   Mandatory Fine             $100.00
Individuals who observe someone riding a non-ADA personal electric device in a location prohibited by our policy should contact the UIC Police at the non-emergency number – 312.996.2830. Violations must be reported at the time they occur. Staff and faculty violators will be reported to UIC Human Resources and/or Faculty Affairs. Students in violation of the policy will be reported directly to the Dean of Student Affairs. Repeated violations by an individual may lead to disciplinary action.
Appeals:
All student appeals must go through the Dean of Students Office by going to dos.uic.edu (Student Disciplinary Policy) and all faculty/staff appeals must go through Human Resources by going to www.hr.uic.edu.
Parking Locations for E-Scooters:
City of Chicago shared e-scooters procedures should be observed per program specifications. Personal e-scooters must be docked at designated docking locations in scooter/skateboard docks.
