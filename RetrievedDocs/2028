As a part of UIC’s Graduate College, the International Teaching Assistant Program provides three main services for international teaching assistants (ITAs) and the academic departments that employ them:

conducting oral English proficiency testing for all non-native English-speaking TAs in compliance with Illinois state law
providing courses to help ITAs and other international graduate students improve their English language, communication, and teaching skills
offering drop-in workshops and casual social events to give ITAs and other international graduate students more opportunities to use their English outside of the classroom

Note:  The ITA Program does not currently have any available TA positions and does not assist graduate students in finding TA positions.
