TestimonialBeing a part of the Honors College has helped me grow and be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that have been presented to me. Knowing that you have such a tight support system consisting of people that want to see you succeed is very motivating and encourages you to take risks. If it weren’t for me knowing this I probably would have held back on many of my decisions in fear of losing my opportunity to continue my education.- Angelica Gallegos, Computer Science, Class of 2017
