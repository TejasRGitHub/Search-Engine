            Our New Housing Portal
          
The Housing Portal is a location where students can apply for Campus Housing, view offered room assignments and sign their Housing contract (in My Bookings), select a Move-In Time, and more!






            What are the options for a loft, refrigerator, and microwave?
          
We recommend renting from Bedloft.com because all of their products are department-approved, guaranteeing that your product will meet our policies. Bedloft.com provides free on-site service throughout the entire academic year creating continuous ease and convenience from start to finish.

Note – if you have not yet signed your Housing contract, you cannot rent from Bedloft.com as ordering requires knowing your Housing room assignment.






            Virtual Tour Options
          
We invite you to explore Campus Housing room and unit options in a virtual 360-degree tour. Operating 8 residence halls with 27 different room styles, it’s likely we have an option for you. Come see the benefits of living on campus for yourself!
