At UIC’s Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, the sky isn’t even the limit.
Our alumni are working on NASA projects that will send research probes to Jupiter’s moons. Our students and faculty are creating and perfecting machinery at the tiniest scale, working with nanomaterials and nanosystems.
We are on the frontiers of sustainability. We have world-class experts in fluids and combustion. We are exploring, simulating, and implementing improvements that can be made possible with excellent design.
You can be, too. We invite you to get to know our undergraduate programs, which welcome between 150 and 200 new students each year.

UIC prepared me in various ways for work. Each class equipped me with the knowledge to understand an array of problems and to be able to approach them with a step-by-step mentality, considering both pros and cons. I am very grateful for the student organizations as they trained, equipped, and motivated me along the way by giving me hope and vision for who I could become.
