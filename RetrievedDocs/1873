What is E-CHUG?
The University of Illinois – Chicago is giving its students free access to the eCHECKUP TO GO, an evidence-based online prevention intervention. This tool provides personalized feedback that helps to show how your drinking habits, family history, and campus norms affect your life and future. The e-CHUG is a brief assessment tool that takes 15-20 minutes to complete, is self-guided, requires no face-to-face contact with a counselor, and is completely anonymous.
Why Do I Want to Take It?  
E-CHUG will provide you with customized feedback based on your answers.  It will raise your awareness about possible problem areas and provide solutions. Rest assured that your answers remain private.  You can take it once or on multiple occasions to track changes in your alcohol use (just remember to keep your e-CHUG identification number). The program is available exclusively for use by UIC students, it does not constitute a formal assessment and cannot be used in court.
