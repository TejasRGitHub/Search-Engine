Landscape view of Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, home to the world’s largest albatross colony, with more than a million Laysan Albatross returning to breed each year. However, invasive house mice began to attack and kill nesting albatross and are consequently slated for eradication in July 2022.

American Framing, the U.S. Pavilion at the 17th International Venice Architecture Biennale, 2021
Softwood construction originated in the early 19th century United States as a pragmatic, accessible structural system for settlers with limited resources and technical skills. Today, 90 percent of American homes are built with wood framing—an ordinary sameness in a country that celebrates individuality. Curated by School of Architecture faculty members Paul Andersen and Paul Preissner, the U.S. Pavilion at the 2021 Venice Architecture Biennale calls attention to this ubiquitous but overlooked building method in a collection of designed and documentary works. A four-story installation—a familiar but monumental half-section of a wood-framed house, with exaggerated proportions—forms a new facade through which visitors enter. Inside the pavilion's galleries, commissioned photographs explore the social realities and cultural mythologies of wood framing; physical models, built by School of Architecture students as part of advanced seminars on the topic, illustrate significant historical examples. School faculty Ania Jaworska and Thomas Kelley (with his practice Norman Kelley) contributed furniture that reinterprets softwood construction to the installation and the courtyard it defines.

Genome Research Core
Loading of the SpectroCHIP Array into the MassARRAY System (Agena Bioscience) for high-throughput genotyping. This system uses matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for the precise detection of genetic variants by analysis of their individual mass, eliminating the need for fluorescence or labeling.
