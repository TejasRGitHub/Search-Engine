Community Standards
Community Standards empowers students to uphold the community values of integrity, accountability, and respect. In instances where student’s behavioral choices are potentially in conflict with these values, the office facilitates a variety of methods meant to fairly resolve conflicts, hold students found responsible accountable, and spur their ethical and educational development. Additionally, the office provides education and training programs for faculty, staff and students about community standards issues.
