Amazon Business available again

				November 2, 2022			

Amazon Business is available again for university purchases made with a P-Card.
Former Amazon Business Account members will receive an email once their account has been activated. P-Cardholders who have not previously held an Amazon Business Account membership can request an Amazon Business account.
The new Amazon Business account offers many business-specific benefits, including:

Prime-only purchases, ensuring best value and compliance with Illinois law.
Automatic tax-exempt purchasing on items sold by Amazon.com LLC and participating third-party sellers.
Access to millions of additional products, available only to business customers.
Business-specific pricing, including quantity discounts on eligible items.
Access to a specialized Amazon Business customer service team.
University P-Card purchases only, for a seamless reconciliation.
Prohibition on personal purchases, eliminating denials in reimbursement.

Questions can be directed to UICPurchasing@uillinois.edu.
