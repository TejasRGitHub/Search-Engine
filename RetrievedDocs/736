Each year, Americans observe National Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15, by celebrating the histories, cultures and contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America. Latinx people are incredibly impactful to the United States, Chicago, and our college. UIC Is proud to be a college with a diverse student body, and to celebrate Latinx Students during this month and always.  During this Month, the Center for Student Involvement will be hosting events to showcase and celebrate the Latinx community at UIC. For Latinx Heritage Month, Daley Library has compiled a list of books  by Latinx authors that discuss and celebrate this history in the United States.
