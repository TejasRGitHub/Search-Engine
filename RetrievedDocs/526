Social Media Account Request Form

All official UIC social media accounts must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Strategic Marketing and Communications. 
SMC’s goal is to provide counsel and support campus social media managers and page administrators to use social media channels as effectively as possible to reach audiences and uphold the reputation of UIC. SMC will routinely review all UIC-affiliated social media pages to ensure they adhere to SMC’s social media policies and guidelines and will reach out to social media managers as needed to discuss solutions for pages that need support. 
Each new page will be under review for the first six months of its existence to ensure that it conforms to our policies and guidelines. 
Please fill out
