Guaranteed Paid Internship Program

UIC Engineering offers guaranteed paid internships to all incoming freshmen and transfer students who are able to fulfill the participation requirements. For example, students must maintain a 3.2 GPA each semester in order to maintain program eligibility. Freshmen meet program requirements during their first fall and spring semesters and are placed during the summer. Transfer students meet program requirements over multiple semesters and are placed the summer before their final year or semester on campus.
The Guaranteed Paid Internship Program (GPIP) places students in paid positions in one of 42 UIC research laboratories and in other university departments. Student progress of required courses is tracked by the program and once students have met all requirements, they have the opportunity to review open internships before the placement process begins.
Students describe GPIP as a significant force in accelerating their trajectory into future internships after their sophomore and junior years. The program reflects UIC Engineering’s commitment to helping our students lay the best possible groundwork for post-graduation career success.

My first internship through GPIP was in research, and the experience prepared me well for approaching new projects and positions. I knew very little about the work required for the assignment coming in, but I learned that you don’t need to know everything to be able to contribute to a project.

            The Guaranteed Paid Internship Program is just one of many avenues that UIC students can take toward paid work experience. Build your résumé by pursuing one—or all—of these options as well.
          



Corporate internships

You picked a school in one of the most vibrant and amazing U.S. cities for a reason, right? Going to college in Chicago allows you to complete internships at companies not only during the summer (when everyone else does) but also during the fall and spring semesters. Nearly 100% of engineering and computer science internships are paid. Visit the Engineering Career Center website to start your search.



REUs

REUs are Research Experiences for Undergraduates, paid opportunities that can take you all over the country. Most participants receive housing or a housing stipend in addition to their compensation for working with a faculty member at another university on a research project. REUs are sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Search the NSF database for opportunities.



Government programs

State and local government agencies allow college students to gain work experience and possibly lay the groundwork for full-time positions after graduation. UIC Engineering students have worked for the Chicago Department of Buildings, Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois Tollway, and various departments of Cook County and other neighboring counties. For city internships, for example, search here.

GPIP helps with getting first experiences in engineering, and the internship helps you become a more competitive applicant for other positions.
