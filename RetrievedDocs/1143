Weeks of Welcome

UIC Welcomes all new and returning students to campus! Come celebrate the beginning of a new school year with us!
Click here to find out more.



Involvement Fair

Each semester, the Center for Student Involvement hosts an annual “kick-off” event for the students, faculty, and staff of UIC, to celebrate not only the beginning of the semester but also to introduce the campus to the many involvement opportunities in the surrounding the UIC community and the city. The Involvement Fair will expose students to the diverse engagement opportunities available at UIC. Over 400 student organizations, university departments, and neighboring businesses will be on hand to greet and welcome students to campus.
 



Spark

Spark is UIC’s annual fall music festival. This event is open to UIC students, faculty, and staff and their guests. Spark aims to bring local, national, little known, and well known artists to campus. The music fest offers an eclectic mix of entertainment for UIC’s diverse campus community.
Since Spark in the Park began, the UIC Community has been entertained with great music performances from Lupe Fiasco, The Cool Kids, Flosstradamus, The Hood Internet, Barefoot Truth, Footlight Frenzy, Girl Talk, Kid Cudi, Twenty-One Pilots, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Nick Jonas, and H.E.R. Every Fall, UIC looks forward to providing the campus community with yet another amazing music festival.

Homecoming

Homecoming is a long-standing American tradition where colleges and high schools would welcome current students and alumni back to campus and the community. The earliest homecoming celebrations centered around alumni football games.
Today, homecoming still shares many of these same features but has broadened its reach. Now it is an annual tradition where alumni, students, fans and community members come together to honor a school’s traditions and history.



Flames Finish Strong

At the end of every semester, CSI teams up with others around the campus to help students thrive during finals. Students can grab a cup of coffee or tea to stay awake, have a cookie in between study breaks, or, if study sessions run late, score a midnight breakfast; all students with a valid i-card can participate. Events and services are subject to change.

Forever Flames

At the end of the Fall and Spring semesters, CSI hosts Forever Flames. Forever Flames celebrates our graduates’ achievements, and offers a time for graduates to reflect upon their time at UIC. This week of activities  is dedicated to giving graduates time to think about the people who have been impactful to their UIC experience, the relationships they have gained, as well as easing the transition into alumni status. Forever Flames culminates in the Grad Toast open to all graduating seniors.
