About

I am a Professor in the Computer Science department at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). I am also an adjunct faculty at the Bioengineering department in UIC. My research interests span several areas such as Theoretical Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics/Algorithms, Computational Biology, Computational Geometry and Computational Finance. I received the NSF CAREER award in 2004 and the UIC College of Engineering Teaching Award in 2012. I thankfully acknowledge generous support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for my research activities.
