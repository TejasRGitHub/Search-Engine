APA Accredited Doctoral Internship Program in Health Service Psychology






APA Accredited Doctoral Internship Program in Health Service Psychology
The Doctoral Internship Program in Health Service Psychology is a full-time, 42.5 hour week program that incorporates a developmental model of training encouraging increasing levels of independence for trainees as their capabilities expand, while supervision is maintained as the cornerstone of the training program. The internship is 2000 hours and is structured with approximately 75% time for direct and indirect services and 25% time for supervision and didactic seminars. As part of the staff, interns are invited to participate in many of the administrative structures and functions of the setting, including intern or extern selection committees and the Multicultural Staff Meeting. Input from interns and is highly valued and remains an integral part of helping to shape the quality and direction of our training programs.
The Counseling Center is staffed by Licensed Clinical Psychologists, Staff Therapists, Social Workers, and a Psychiatrist, and emphasizes direct service provision. The Counseling Center functions as the comprehensive mental health agency for the UIC student community. As such, initial consultations, crisis intervention, individual psychotherapy, general and specialized group therapies, case management, outreach and consultation, systems linkage and advocacy are major responsibilities for all psychological staff and trainees. The Counseling Center also affords considerable opportunities to work with other disciplines and programs across the University.
Our program has been accredited since 1986.  In 2022, the Commission on Accreditation voted to reaffirm accreditation of the program, with its next site visit scheduled to be held in 2032. Questions related to the program’s accredited status can be directed to the Commission on Accreditation:
