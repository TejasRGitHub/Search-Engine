Request a Letter for Proof of Insurance
If you are not registering for courses for the Fall or Spring semester, CampusCare cannot cover you under the program regardless of the circumstance, i.e. medical leave of absence, graduation, etc. You will have to obtain insurance through a private insurance company or through the Affordable Care Act at getcoveredillinois.gov.
If you need a Letter of Proof of Insurance (also known as Letter of Credible Coverage) for your new insurance company, please email cchealth@uic.edu with the following information:

First and Last Name
UIN#
A Brief description of what you are requesting

Please allow 3 to 5 business days for us to process your request. We will email you back a letter that you can take to your new insurance. Letters of Credible Coverage will be provided after the deadline date for the semester has passed.
*CampusCare cannot change effective or end dates of coverage.
