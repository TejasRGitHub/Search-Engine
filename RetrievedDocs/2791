All first-year fall entry students are automatically placed into a unique academic cohort comprised of 60-70 students each. Our cohorts are designed to meet the academic, social, and professional needs of students. Each cohort takes five core business courses together during their first two years, which allows faculty to tailor the foundational content and engage closely with each cohort. Additional support for cohorts is provided by dedicated academic advisors, career coaches and cohort peer leaders.
