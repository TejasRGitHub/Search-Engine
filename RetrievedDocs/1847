Peer Support
United Support Network

United Support Network (USN) is a community of students coming together to support each other through life’s challenges and connect around life experiences. USN provides weekly support groups for UIC students as well as monthly, fun, social, stress-busting events.
USN group leaders enroll in a class and are trained by Counseling Center staff to provide peer-to-peer mental health support.
