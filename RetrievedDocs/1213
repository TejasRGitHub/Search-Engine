In the spirit of healing, the Native American Support Program (NASP) acknowledges and honors the original peoples of the Chicagoland area, the Three Fires Confederacy – Potawatomi, Odawa and Ojibwe Nations; and other Tribal Nations -Menominee, Ho-Chunk, and the many Indigenous people who call it home – past, present, future.
For 50 years, NASP, a unit at the University of Illinois at Chicago has provided resources for Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other indigenous students to enhance their individual growth and development, leadership skills, and academic achievement.
