            Innovation ≠ Invention
          Heading link



 
Copy link



Innovation is the application of abstract knowledge in a new way.
Innovation is applied and good innovation moves away from more traditional applications. The work we do is in pursuit of solving a specific problem for a partner. It cannot live apart from a need. How the need is identified, how we define the problem, how we view the current landscape, and the way we bring technology into the solution are all ingredients for innovation.








            Integrative thinking
          Heading link



 
Copy link







 

Integrative thinking is inclusive. It allows for a diverse range of complex solutions, as well as a diverse combination of innovators.
Our innovation process isn’t discipline-specific. Innovation is collectively created and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to the process because personal perspectives, histories, socio-cultural background, race, and gender all contribute to framing and solving a problem. The way people work through ambiguity and complexity contributes to resolving conflicting desires that problems almost always have.


 








            Our process
          Heading link



 
Copy link



Our Innovation process is divergent, convergent, non-linear, and multifaceted. In reality it is uncomfortably ambiguous. Our process is based on a framework that uses a compilation of tools from Business, the Social Sciences, Engineering, and Design.

Expanding our reach.
We are expanding our reach within the university, providing interdisciplinary innovation opportunities across campus. We play a central role in being the place of integration and collaboration for the university. This requires more space for student teams, classes, sponsored labs, and cross-college events. Our working methods require more flexibility, room for growth, security for partners, openness for the community, and visibility to the university.


Creating an innovation talent force for the City of Chicago.
We are the front door to UIC’s corporate collaboration initiatives. When civic leaders and corporate partners visit the Innovation Center, they see and understand the interdisciplinary collaboration methods we possess to provide new skills, help solve complex problems, and create and retain talent in our city.


Our new space.
To work with us on the design of our expansion, we are partnering with JGMA, a company that understands how we work, and how architecture can support and reflect some of our core values: integrity in the work; honesty in materials; transparency in our methods; and celebration of our solutions.


Place and space matter.
The Innovation Center is a story-telling space. Experiential learning methods and outcomes are demonstrated and displayed as a way to understand, communicate, and develop ideas. The new space will reflect our working methods and add additional capacity for new projects, and educational offerings, as well as creating presentation and exhibition spaces, to help knit the campus together.


A space that empowers.
UIC is a significant provider of talent showcasing the work and accomplishments our students, faculty, and corporate partners do together will be magnified through a facility that supports our goals, methods, and outcomes.


Reimagining the future.
Change happens, all of the time. We approach our work with a mindset that constant evolution is the only way to advance in the world we inhabit. Improving our ability to enhance collaboration, bringing different disciplines and viewpoints together, and expanding exposure to ideas will increase UIC’s ability to change the future.

Access to Talent, Innovation, and Ideas
IXD provides our partners access to student talent, access to innovative thinking, and access to diversity through our innovative curriculum. There are 120+ students in classes at the Innovation Center, including 20 disciplines.


Access to Talent
The student discipline mix is designed to align with a partner’s problem domain. Partners have the opportunity to work closely with 25 to 50 students from multiple disciplines, across two semesters. This direct connection between partner and senior-level student provides an excellent platform for targeted recruiting, and evidence of qualification. We have had students hired directly from our classes and labs into companies like Caterpillar, Northern Trust, Dell Technologies, Amazon, BD Medical, Anthem, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.


Access to Innovative Thinking
Our teams bring new, unencumbered thinking to longstanding problems. We are outsiders, with a set of methods and tools that allow problem framing and solution development that comes from a truly a fresh perspective. Aside from specific solution innovation, our partners have access to our curriculum, teaching methods, and tools, which have helped accelerate innovation initiatives within their organizations.


Access to Diversity
UIC is one of the most diverse universities in the United States. Our corporate partners have access to a body of students that represents what the US is rapidly becoming—a majority minority population. In our classes, we encourage students to engage in integrative thinking, which leverages discipline knowledge along with personal experiences, perspectives, and beliefs. These are all shaped by socio-economic and socio-cultural conditions. Every problem we solve is viewed by teams from multiple vantage points. Having access to this student population has value for our partners. 










            Corporate Labs

About

Multidisciplinary teams of dedicated student employees and advising faculty work on medical challenges brought to the lab from the college of medicine. Teams work on medical devices and services assessing the needs and viability of proposals, conducting observational research, concept development, and prototyping, in an effort to bring products to potential commercial partners. See an example from ORBIT Lab, published in the Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology.



Partner Benefits

Medical labs are a resource for a variety of clinicians who are dissatisfied with current methods, tools, processes, or communication approaches. Our distinct medical labs concentrate on surgical tools and methods, urological devices, ophthalmology tools, and health applications to improve communication between providers and patients.



Student Learning Outcomes

Students from multiple disciplines learn to work in teams to solve problems in very unfamiliar territory. Often, radically new approaches are developed by teams that approach problems from a distinctly non-medical point of view. Insights from the uninitiated allow for new ways to think through problems, or bring adjacent arenas into the solution development.
