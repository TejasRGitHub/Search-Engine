The Richard and Loan Hill Department of Biomedical Engineering faculty teach a diverse, talented student population in the heart of Chicago, where they are fully supported by a Research 1 institution that is committed to discovery and progress.
The department has a tradition of strength in cell and tissue engineering, neural engineering, bioinformatics, biomedical imaging, biomechanics, and biomolecular engineering. Its 46 core faculty work alongside more than 100 affiliate faculty who represent departments across the UIC Colleges of Liberal Arts and Science, Applied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Engineering, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nursing. UIC Biomedical Engineering is committed to offering excellent opportunities in research and teaching across many areas of interest and expertise.
UIC biomedical engineering students help to make UIC one of the most diverse institutions in the country. Graduates of our undergraduate program tend to enter positions in industry (approximately 40 percent) or go on to professional schools (medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, law; 30 percent) and graduate programs (30 percent). Alumni of our graduate programs pursue careers in industry, academia, national research labs, and medicine.
The UIC chapters of the Biomedical Engineering Society, Engineering World Health, and IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society provide an outlet for students to discuss topics in biomedical engineering and to work together on projects to promote health in the community and around the world. The UIC Bioengineering Student Journal allows students at all levels to engage in scholarly publication and get an early start on their research careers. Biomedical engineering faculty members support all of these groups as formal advisors and informal guides.
