Dear UIC Student, Welcome!
The UIC Wellness Center wants to support your academic success and your college journey by providing healthful services, programs, education, and resources like the UIC Pop-Up Pantry.  We recognize that food is a critical resource that supports your cognitive functioning, learning, physical health, and emotional wellbeing.  Running the Pantry is just one of many ways that the Wellness Center supports you.
The UIC Pop-Up Pantry is a free resource to help registered UIC students who are Food Insecure.  This means that Food Insecure students are getting the help they need to thrive.
How do you know if you are Food Insecure?  Answer these two questions:

 “I worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.” Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months?
“The food I bought just didn’t last, and we didn’t have money to get more.” Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months

A response of “often true” or “sometimes true” to either question = positive screen for Food Insecurity. 
If you are a Food Insecure student, please click on “Information” below to learn more about the Pantry and where to register.
If you are interested in volunteering or donating to the UIC Pop-Up Pantry, please click on the “Donation” link. This page contains a video and suggestions on how to support the Pantry.
