COVID-19 University Travel Guidance






COVID-19 University Travel Guidance
Please review the information below when considering travel on official university business.
The university requires faculty, staff and students traveling for essential university business domestically and internationally to obtain prior approval from their unit head. Travelers are also required to review UIC travel guidelines.
Please be sure to make note of any testing requirements upon your return from traveling. Information about on-campus COVID-19 saliva testing is available here.
Should travelers be asked to make a commitment to an event or speaking engagement that requires travel months in the future, individuals are advised to request unit head approval and if approved, to accept the invitation with the understanding that travel guidance for the destination may be impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions.
Please note that this travel policy is subject to change based upon any continued developments in federal, state or local guidance (Updated: 10/24/22).

                            UNIVERSITY-SPONSORED INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
                    








            University-sponsored international travel
          

The university requires faculty, staff and students traveling internationally for essential university business to do the following:

Obtain prior approval from their unit head.
Enroll in the university’s International Travel Safety (ITS) portal. For more information and to access the ITS portal. please visit the Office of Global Engagement’s website.
Depending on destination and current COVID-19 conditions, travelers may be required to register their travel plans with UIC contact tracing.

For additional information or questions, contact the Office of Global Engagement for more information at oge@uic.edu.
The U.S. Department of State, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) have all issued global health and travel advisories. The University strongly urges UIC community members to avoid travel to any country with a CDC Level 3 or Department of State Level 4 risk designation. The CDC Level 3 countries are listed on the CDC website and may change frequently. A full list of CDC travel advisories can be found here.
Based on current CDC COVID-19 recommendations, international travelers should avoid all travel to destinations the CDC classifies as ‘Level 4: COVID-19 Very High’” and reconsider international travel to destinations that are classified as ‘Level 3: COVID-19 High’. If travel is deemed necessary, we strongly urge faculty and staff to enroll with the U.S. Embassy in each country they are visiting (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, known as STEP).
Additionally, travelers should prepare for the possibility of local quarantines in some locations; flight cancellations; and that return to the U.S. from some international destinations may be delayed or even impossible. Travelers to any international destination should recognize the potential for challenges in returning to the U.S. – including CDC required negative test results or documentation that must be provided prior to departure for the U.S.
Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel are able to request departmental/unit/college/university approval by following the procedures listed in the UIC COVID-19 Travel Procedures section below. Depending upon the destination, travelers may be required to register travel with UIC contact tracing.






            Returning from international travel
          

Depending on the current guidance, employees may be required to quarantine after international travel. Individuals who have been working remotely should continue to do so during this quarantine period.  For employees who have been working on-site, the department may choose to allow the employee to work remotely during the quarantine period if operationally feasible.  If the employee is required to work on-site and remote work cannot be assigned or completed the employee must utilize benefit time.
In accordance with Public Act 102-0697 and effective April 5, 2022, the University of Illinois System offers COVID-19 Paid Administrative Leave to employees who are fully vaccinated, or have approved medical or religious COVID-19 vaccination accommodation, and who are unable to work or telework for reasons related to COVID-19 during a public health emergency. For details, please visit the UI System HR site.

            University-sponsored domestic travel
          

The university limits all university-sponsored out-of-state, domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business. Those who believe they have an essential reason to travel shall request approval through their unit executive officer.
Permission for university-sponsored travel within the United States may be granted for essential university business. Travel plans should follow guidelines from the CDC, Illinois Department of Health, and the City of Chicago.  In some special circumstances, such as Athletics, the Chancellor, in conformance with NCAA directives, may grant a blanket approval.
