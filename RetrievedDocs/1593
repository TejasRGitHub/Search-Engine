At the School of Public Health (SPH), we offer three programs designed for undergraduate students: the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health, the Bachelor of Science in Public Health, and the Minor in Public Health. These programs prepare graduates for entry into the workforce, pursuit of careers in the health sciences, or admission to graduate programs. Whatever your aspirations, you will find that a foundation in public health prepares educated citizens conscious of the factors that shape health and quality of life for individuals and societies. More information about our undergraduate offerings is available on our website: https://go.uic.edu/undergrad-public-health
