          UIC's Surgical Innovation Training Lab
        


UIC’s Surgical Innovation Training Lab (SITL) won the Design for Adaptation and Transformation category at the 2022 European Healthcare Design Awards.
Foundational to SITL’s innovative design is that the laboratory borrows from theater stage design to create a highly flexible and adaptable space for research and training in minimally invasive and robotic surgery, helping secure UI Health’s leadership in those techniques.
