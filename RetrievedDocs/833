Lecture Capture






Lecture Capture

With lecture capture, instructors can easily record lectures as videos and allow students to review them after class. Lecture capture systems offer three important benefits: an alternative when students miss class; an opportunity for content review; and content for online course development. Lecture capture enhances and extends existing instructional activities, whether in face-to-face, fully online, or blended learning environments.
Depending on how the recordings are created or edited, they may constitute educational records that are protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) — the federal student privacy law. Review the Lecture Recording Privacy FAQs to learn more.
