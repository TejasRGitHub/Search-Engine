Understanding Salaries






Understanding Salaries
Know Your Worth
It is important to know your salary expectations before heading into an interview or a possible negotiation. By doing your research ahead of time, you can feel more comfortable in asking for what you're worth without asking for too much or too little.

Review the job description and quantify the number of qualifications the employer is seeking vs. what you have. This will help determine your desired salary. Example: If you have 9 out of 10 qualifications in a job description, you should feel confident asking for a higher number since you have 90% of what they are seeking.
Also research the salary trends for your major, desired job title, and geographic location. Use at least 3 reputable resources to find this information so you have appropriate data to compare.
