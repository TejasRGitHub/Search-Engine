In this series of three workshops, you will learn about diabetes, its impact on the body and the importance of keeping it under control. You will learn ways to help manage diabetes through healthy eating and will also participate in a live virtual cooking demo.
For the cooking demo, the recipe and cooking ingredient list will be made available to all who attend prior to the session if you would like to cook along!
For those who attend all three sessions, we have a special surprise available for you (to be picked up on campus).
Workshop schedule, topics and registration are below. You only need to register once to attend all three sessions, and you will receive the meeting link that will be used for all three sessions when you register.
