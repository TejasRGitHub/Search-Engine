The UIC branch of Women in Computer Science thanks all the people that have been involved over the past years and helped us grow as a community. We continue to learn and be more involved with other organizations to help foster a better and safer community within the Computer Science department.
Everyday we hope to engage and reach more members to become a part of the WiCS community. Our Executive Board and members are what make this organization great. Click to learn more about our members and our officers. Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
