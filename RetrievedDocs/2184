In the case that the policy holder for the insurance which covered the student and dependents has terminated, the student and their dependents are able to reinstate into the CampusCare program after the Enrollment Period. An electronic Dependent add form and a Letter of Credible Coverage from the insurance company stating termination of coverage for the dependent along with the marriage certificate, civil union partnership certificate, birth certificate, hospital footprint certificate, and/or adoption or legal guardianship papers needs to be sent to the CampusCare administration office. The Dependent’s effective date will be the date CampusCare administration receives all necessary documentation and verifies eligibility. The student of UIC must submit a reinstatement form electronically in order to be covered by CampusCare and for any dependents to be added. The student’s coverage will begin the day the electronic reinstatement form is submitted.
