            SABER - A Versatile Cluster
          
UIC's first open access cluster with HPC and Big Data capabilities, SABER is now available for use on a pay-per-use model






            Hypersonic Flights
          
Our researchers are working on simulations of supersonic combustors for future hypersonic flights. With more computation power, we achieve the desired simulations in an efficient manner.






            Molecular Dynamics Simulations
          
Using the HPC, physicists at UIC are studying permeation processes across cellular membranes using Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The figure shows a membrane protein (AcrB) that transports substrates across bacterial membrane.






            NSF Awards
          
ACER collaborated with Professor Farzad Mashayek of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering to win two NSF awards with $1.1 Mill in funding that will build UIC’s first Big Data campus cluster (named SABER) and extend High-Performance Research Network (HPRNet) to facilitate faster data movements over Internet2.
