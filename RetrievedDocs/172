About

I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of University of Illinois at Chicago.
Prior to joining UIC, I was at UC Berkeley Simons Institute and Microsoft Research. I received my Ph.D. in 2016 from Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Xi Chen.
Research Interests:
Design and analysis of algorithms, including graph algorithms, parallel algorithms, dynamic algorithms, and distributed algorithms.
