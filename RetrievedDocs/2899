            What is ECE?
          Heading link

Electrical and computer engineers have the opportunity to make an extraordinary impact on the world around us.
That is because nearly every aspect of our lives is touched by electrical and computer technology. These fields help to determine how long your phone battery lasts, how the light in your bedroom can be connected to your smart watch, how robots assemble the products you use every day, how autonomous vehicles drive themselves, and more.
You get the picture: life as we know it today would not be possible without the knowledge, skills, and innovative thinking of electrical and computer engineers.
ECE, as we call it, is one cohesive department at UIC, but it houses three majors—any one of which can be the start of an extremely rewarding career. Consider these options:

                            Computer Engineering
                    

                Computer engineers devise the systems that make modern computing technology possible.
            









                            Electrical Engineering
                    

                Electrical engineering covers a range of areas, from electromagnetics, nanotechnologyto renewable energy.
            









                            Engineering Physics
                    

                Engineering physics combines the strengths of a hard science (physics) with the applied approach of engineering.
