                Student Employment
              


















The Student Employment Office is responsible for administrating all aspects of on-campus employment including hiring procedures, policies, best practices, and enforces compliance with university and state/federal regulations. We develop resources for student employment training and evaluation to provide students and their supervisors with meaningful and professional experiences. We offer one-on-one advising, career development workshops and events throughout the year.
 
We are open Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. You can connect with us at 312-996-3130 or studentjobs@uic.edu
