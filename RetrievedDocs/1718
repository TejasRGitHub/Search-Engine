Your Identity at Work
Need Support in Your Job Search?
Every student's job search is unique and challenging in different ways. The ECC understands that searching for a job can bring up questions related to your identity. To help, we have compiled this list of both on- campus and off-campus resources. You can also speak with your career advisor or someone you trust. If you are part of a group that's not represented here, or if you know of a great resource that should be listed here, please contact Jonna (Cottrell) McHugh to let her know.
