Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics is a national LGBTQ+ affirming organization that aims to provide services and support for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and to create a dynamic network between students and professionals in industry and academia.
oSTEM strives to provide a safe space for all people to express themselves. To that end, we have and hold ourselves to a high-level and broad diversity policy, built around respect for individuals regardless of where they are on life’s journey. oSTEM prohibits discrimination based on gender, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, color, ethnicity, citizenship, cultural background, socioeconomic status, age, disability, religion, or veteran status. Furthermore, oSTEM prohibits any harassment that detracts from the learning experience or threatens an individual in any form.
