As part of the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for Access and Equity (OAE), strives to increase access to employment, programs, and services in an environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment. Dispute Resolution Services (DRS) provides confidential consultation, facilitation, and mediation services to students, faculty, academic and support staff.







OAE Statement of Reaffirmation








            Black Lives Matter

The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and countless other members of the Black community have further exposed the racist beliefs, behaviors, and systems that Black people experience in America. The Office for Access and Equity reaffirms our commitment to cultivate an environment where our Black community members experience racial equity as a reality and not an aspiration. We denounce racism against all groups and will continue to provide support and resources for those who are impacted by harassment or discrimination.
