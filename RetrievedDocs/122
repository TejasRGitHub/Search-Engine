            Timesheet Submission Procedure

Copy link



Procedure for student (employee):

Label timesheet as: LastName_FirstName_Timesheet_EndDate, replacing the EndDate part with an eight-digit code for the pay period end date. For example, the pay period end date for 8/7/2022 – 8/20/2022 would be written as 08202022 and the timesheet would be labeled as follows: LastName_FirstName_Timesheet_08202022
Send completed and properly labeled timesheet to your supervisor/instructor by the due date. Only one late timesheet and two reminders on WebTime per semester is allowed.
Submit WebTime (which must match the hours in timesheet) as soon you submit your timesheet to your supervisor.

Procedure for faculty or staff member (supervisor):

Send signed timesheet as PDF, labeled properly, as an attachment to this email address: UIC_CS_.ccz36k1v70c4lbcf @ u.box.com. (Note: Please manually remove the spaces from around the @ sign when you paste this address into your email “To:” field.)
You may attach multiple timesheets to one email, but do not combine multiple PDFs into one. Keep timesheets separate for each employee.
Submit timesheets by 9 a.m. on Monday after the pay period ends.
