About


Student Success






The UIC Library aspires to integrate critical reflection and inquiry in undergraduate education across disciplines.






            Introduction
          Heading link

We envision every student graduating with skills to seek, evaluate, organize, use, and create information and to engage in dialogue for deeper learning. UIC students will honor their own experiences and contribute confidently to discourse in academic, professional and civic communities.
UIC Library faculty pursue this vision through student centered, culturally sustaining, and active learning opportunities embedded in the curriculum (library instruction, Dialogue courses) and co-curricular settings (Undergraduate Engagement Program), as well as individual interactions with students.
