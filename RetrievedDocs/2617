                            Deterministic Multithreading
                    

                Consequence: Achieves deterministic execution via store buffering and strict  ordering of synchronization operations  
            









                            Delegation for Efficient Multi-Threading
                    

                In this NSF-funded project, we study delegation as an alternative to synchronized access to shared memory
            









                            Congestion control for RDMA
                    

                Addresses the challenge of achieving extreme low latency in datacenter networks for Online Big Data (OLBD) applications
            









                            Tail Latency in Datacenters
                    

                Address the shortcomings that cause long latency tails in the datacenter network
            









                            Cache-efficient index access for large datasets
                    

                 Improving index access in data-intensive applications
            









                            Cloudsweeper
                    

                We provide tools to help users understand and control their risks online
