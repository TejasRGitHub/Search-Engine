            As Chicago’s only public law school, UIC Law is driven by its commitment to serve the people of Chicago and beyond. Each year, our Community Legal Clinics provide millions of dollars in pro bono services to people in need. As a law student, under the direction of experienced attorneys, you will assist real people with real legal problems—victims of domestic violence or housing discrimination, veterans denied VA benefits, entrepreneurs or inventors with limited financial means, individuals seeking protection from persecution, or groups looking to enhance economic opportunities in under-resourced communities. You'll find pride in the change you create and who you become.
