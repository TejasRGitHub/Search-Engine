Workshops are vital for continuing your education, meeting your wellness goals and identifying the important role that overall wellness has on your daily life.  We encourage all individuals and organizations whose members want to live healthier, learn new skills, and support risk management to request any workshop that the Wellness Center offers! At this time, workshops are only available to students affiliated with the University of Illinois system.
We require that you submit a workshop request form 2 weeks prior to the event date so we can ensure that your needs will be met.  For in-person workshops safety is a top priority for our student presenters, we ask that you do not schedule a workshop later than 5 pm.
**To respect our student staff presenters we will not accept any workshop requests that occur 2 weeks before Finals.
Every workshop is free, approximately 40-50 minutes long, and each UIC student attendee will receive a free give-a-way for in-person workshops!
