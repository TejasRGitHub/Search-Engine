Tail Latency in Datacenters






Tail Latency in Datacenters
Reducing latency tails in datacenter networks
Datacenter applications demand both low latency and high throughput; while interactive applications (e.g., Web Search) demand low tail latency for their short messages due to their partition-aggregate software architecture, many data-intensive applications (e.g., Map-Reduce) require high throughput for long flows as they move vast amounts of data across the network. In this ongoing project, we aim to address the shortcomings that cause long latency tails, specifically in packet scheduling and active queue management parts of the datacenter network.
