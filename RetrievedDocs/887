At LAS, our goal is to enable your success in achieving the career that is right for you. Pre-Professional programs are very specific educational goals rather than actual majors and present great opportunities for students in declared majors.
Pre-Health students can compete for internships and undergraduate research opportunities from UIC’s 7 health science colleges, including Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Dentistry, and the Illinois Medical District (IMD), the largest urban medical district with the most diverse population in the U.S.
Pre-Law students enjoy an expanded curriculum which prepares them for exciting work in and beyond the legal field. Students sharpen their research and writing skills while composing legal briefs and essays, and develop critical thinking and analytical skills while interpreting cases. Pre-Law students also refine their presentation, persuasion, and debating skills in classes and mock trials.
