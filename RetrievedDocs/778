The U and I Care Program is an initiative of the Office of the Dean of Students to identify resources and provide assistance to students dealing with personal hardship. The program educates the campus community about services and programs on and off campus. The program empowers students and university personnel to take action in supporting the UIC community. With the multitude of partners within the U and I Care cohort, we are able to connect students with the care that fits their needs best.
