About


I am very proud to be the Academic Lead and PI for Break Through Tech Chicago.
I am also a proud BRAID Department Head.
You should study Computer Science, and I wrote about it before it was trendy. Download and read Robert H. Sloan, "Why Computer Science?" (in a collection, written just before enrollments went from high to extraordinarily high).
I'm excited about Richard Warner's and my last two books: our 2021 book on privacy, and our 2019 book on data breaches (recently released in paperback!).  First publication and third below.

Research Interests:

Computer security, especially privacy, legal, and policy issues.
Computer Science Education.
Application of computer science theory and algorithms to problems from artificial intelligence. Proud member of the UIC theory group.
