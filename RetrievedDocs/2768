            Class Modality – Fall 2022
          Heading link



 
Copy link



Almost all courses in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) will be offered on-campus for the Fall 2022 term. Please note that unless all portions of a course (e.g., all lectures and all discussions) are listed on the Schedule of Courses (my.uic.edu) as “Meet online at set times” or “Online with deadlines,” you should expect to come to campus throughout the semester, and for in-person exams.  You can visit the UIC Office of the Registrar’s Glossary of Terms for class modality definitions. Please check each CRN on the Schedule of Courses to determine your class modality. Please note: only classes with all components listed as “Meet online at set times” or “Online with deadlines” can be expected to have full remote learning. Students who are registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and  have appropriate accommodations limiting their ability to attend in-person, should work directly with the DRC and their instructor(s) regarding class modality. If you have any questions, please contact the DUS by writing to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
