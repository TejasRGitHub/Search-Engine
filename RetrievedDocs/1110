                Chancellor's Undergraduate Research Award
              


















The Chancellor’s Undergraduate Research Award allows students with demonstrated financial need to work as research assistants for hourly pay–at no cost to faculty or departments. Faculty apply online on behalf of the student(s) they have recruited. Students are hired by the faculty member’s department/research unit, just as any other student employee would be, and departments/research units are reimbursed through the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Affairs and Academic Programs at the end of the fiscal year. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis until program funds have been exhausted.
