On the Importance of Logical Centralization in Internet Architecture
Presenter: Arun Venkataramani, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Abstract: Logical centralization of control and management functions, commonly referred to as software-defined networking, has in recent times become a mainstay of enterprise networks. However, logical centralization of key network functions at the Internetwork level has historically received less attention. In this talk, Vekataramani will focus on how logical centralization is powerful in network architecture, a line of research variously referred to as clean-slate, next-generation or future Internet architecture. He will highlight this position through a body of work on and building upon the MobilityFirst future Internet project, an effort aimed at a next-generation Internet design with support for seamless mobility and ground-up security as top-level design principles. Specifically, he will focus on two questions: how can we most effectively support seamless mobility or location-independence in a network architecture; and how can we make interdomain routing across the 50K+ autonomous networks comprising the Internet converge quickly and robustly. Vekataramani will demonstrate that a logically centralized global name service offers the best tradeoff of benefits and costs to support seamless and secure mobility, and a logically centralized cloud-offloaded computation approach can improve interdomain routing convergence times by an order of magnitude.
Speaker bio: Arun Venkataramani is a professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He completed his PhD in computer science at the University of Texas, Austin in 2004, and subsequently joined University of Massachusetts, Amherst via a visiting faculty appointment through the University of Washington. His research broadly spans networking and distributed systems. He is a recipient of an NSF CAREER award, and his research has received several best paper awards including USENIX NSDI 2007, USENIX NSDI 2008, and ACM Sigcomm CoNEXT 2009.
Faculty host: Balajee Ramanan
