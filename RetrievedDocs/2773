The Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science graduate program includes 155 graduate students working in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, mathematical computer science, statistics, and mathematics education.
The University of Illinois at Chicago is a Carnegie-classified Research 1 Institution and the largest institution of higher learning in Chicago. The Department  has an international reputation for top level research with very strong research groups in Algebraic Geometry, Geometry, Topology and Dynamics, Logic (including Set Theory and Model Theory), Number Theory, Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, Combinatorics, Theoretical Computer Science, Statistics and Mathematics Education.
The Department has 47 tenured and tenure track faculty who hold many prestigious awards, including 14 Sloan Foundation Fellows, 18 NSF CAREER grant recipients, 23 Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, 3 SIAM Fellows, 5 Simons Fellows, 6 International Congress of Mathematicians invited speakers, and more. We average over a dozen research seminars each week, host a Friday colloquium series bringing eminent mathematicians, computer scientists, and statisticians to campus, and offer several learning seminars organized by graduate students.
Our graduating students do quite well in academia, and in recent years they have received NSF postdoctoral fellowships at MIT, UC Berkeley, Penn State and prestigious postdoctoral positions at Stony Brook University, U Chicago, UCLA, U Michigan, U Penn, U Toronto, U Maryland, Gottingen, and the University of Warwick. In industry, MSCS alums have accepted positions at Google, Microsoft, Argonne National Laboratory, AbbVie, and Facebook.
