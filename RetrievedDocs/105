General Policy

Final examinations, if they are to be given, are given only during the sixteenth week of the semester (eighth week of the summer term). They may not be given earlier.
What to do if you must miss an exam — Let the instructor know as soon as possible before the exam. If the instructor finds your excuse acceptable, he or she may give you an incomplete and schedule an exam for you at a later date. The instructor is the only individual authorized to permit a student to defer a final exam.
No formal instruction of any kind may be given during the final examination period.
The instructor has the option of giving combined section final exams.

Scheduling of Exams
Final examinations are scheduled according to the time and day(s) the class meets, and the type of class (lecture, lecture discussion, quiz or laboratory):

Time and day(s) that class meets. Determines the day on which the exam is scheduled.
Type of class. When a course involves classes that meet at different times (such as a course with both a lecture and a lab), the time of the course (for purposes of scheduling the exam) is determined by an established order of precedence: lecture, lecture discussion, quiz and laboratory.  (For example, if a course meets as both a lecture and as a laboratory, the final exam would be scheduled according to the time at which the lecture meets.)
Exam Conflicts. The exam schedule is designed to prevent conflicts. But if there is an an exam conflict, the following procedures should be followed::

For Fall terms – course listed first in the online Schedule of Classes has precedence.
For Spring terms – course listed second in the online Schedule of Classes has precedence.
Regularly scheduled final exams and classes, have precedence over combined-section exams.
A student with an exam conflict is responsible for arranging a makeup exam with his or her instructor.


A student having more than two examinations in a day. No student will be required to take more than two final examinations in one day. Any student having more than two final examinations scheduled in one day is entitled to rescheduling. Students must notify the instructor by November 1 in the fall semester and April 1 in the spring semester to be eligible for rescheduling. To resolve this conflict, the student will be required to take the first two examinations scheduled (according to the posted examinations schedule) in any given day. Any third, fourth or additional final examinations that are scheduled on the same day must be rescheduled and taken on another day within finals week.

Final Exam Schedule for Evening Program Courses (Start after 6:00pm)

Finals for Evening Program students are held during the sixteenth week of the semester (or eighth week of the 8 week summer term) at the regularly scheduled class time.
If a class meets more than once a week, the exam should be held on the earlier day of finals week.
No examination should exceed two hours.

Program makeup classes for Labor Day Holiday are to be held on the following Friday. Program Makeup classes for Thanksgiving Holiday are to be held on the preceding Friday.
