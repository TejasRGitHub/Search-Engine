Committees






Committees
UIC is among the nation's most diverse universities and a leader in the sustainability movement in higher education. We consider diversity a strength that contributes to the success of our students, staff, faculty, and institutional research. UIC has developed major climate commitment goals and short-term action items that the campus will implement to address climate change, including teaching and learning opportunities in sustainability.
The following groups are tasked to ensure neither diminished state support nor a more challenging financial environment deters us from our commitment to diversity and confronting the challenges of climate change and sustainability on campus.
