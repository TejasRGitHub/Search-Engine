Welcome to the website of the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs of the University of Illinois Chicago. UIC prides itself on providing students with access to academic excellence and opportunity in an exciting urban environment. We are Chicago’s only public research university, and one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse college campuses in the country, with over 31,000 students, 16 colleges, a hospital and a health sciences system. We are also the home to Chicago’s only public law school, UIC Law.
As UIC’s chief academic officer, I am responsible for the planning, execution, and assessment of UIC’s academic programs so that our students are prepared to pursue their chosen paths in life and to be productive and contributing members of their communities. I am dedicated to the support and retention of our outstanding faculty, and to the recruitment of the next generation of scholars and researchers.
This office, along with the leadership team at UIC is deeply engaged in facilitating the implementation of the strategic priorities identified by the Chancellor and supported through an extensive process of faculty governance. These priorities are:

Student Experience and Success
National Impact and Visibility
Chicago and Community Engagement
Entrepreneurial University

This website contains resources about academic policies and opportunities at UIC. The academic mission is further supported and implemented by the Vice Provosts. Contact the Office of the Provost by email at provost@uic.edu with any questions or concerns.
