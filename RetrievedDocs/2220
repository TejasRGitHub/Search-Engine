UIC Computer Science 


















Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at UIC focuses on semantics, and discourse and dialogue processing. Our goal is to use NLP to support both education and instruction, and collaboration between human or artificial agents. We focus on NLP with a purpose: interfaces and models whose core is NLP technology and that have the potential of positively affecting society.
NLP Lab’s three main strands of research:

NL interfaces for educational technology
Summarization, including for health applications
Multimodal communication, including human-robot interaction and conversational interfaces for visualization
