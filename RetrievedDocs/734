Unconscious Bias

            Unconscious Bias

Implicit bias, bias that occurs unconsciously, can affect our behavior and decision making.  Due to our own experiences, socializations, and beliefs, we can often hold prejudices that we are not fully aware we are enacting.  Although they are not always acted upon, our unconscious biases and those of people around us can change the way we act towards peers of different races, cultures, religions, genders, sexualities and abilities.  While we must make an effort to educate ourselves about the biases that we may hold, we also should be aware of the ways that these biases can affect how we are treated as well.  Unconscious biases affect the way we are perceived in the classroom, workplace, doctor’s office, and other social settings.  Learning to advocate for one’s self and be aware of the biases around us can help us to advocate for others as well.  Understanding what makes us different helps the UIC community grow in diversity.  The UIC office of Diversity Education  provides resources for students who want to learn more about how unconscious biases are formed and what they can do about them.  If you feel you may have been affected by implicit biases within the UIC community, this office also provides space for Bias Reporting and Prevention.
