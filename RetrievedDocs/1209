UIC Student Resources











The Math and Science Learning Center (MSLC) is a welcoming learning environment that provides diverse forms of free academic support to students enrolled in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics introductory courses at UIC. 
Through the MSLC, you will find a friendly team of supporters (Peer Leaders/ Learning Assistants, Faculty, Teaching Assistants, Staff) who are here to help you learn as much as you can during your time at UIC and to help you take the next step in your academic career.  Our Peer Leaders and Learning Assistants are familiar with the curriculum each semester as they have direct connections with the courses and work together with Faculty. Please bring questions from your classes, homework problem sets, lab reports, and projects to receive personalized support and to learn, together with your instructors and classmates.
No appointment is necessary, so please drop-in to our scheduled sessions, as we will be offering in-person and online academic support during the Spring 2022 semester.  Direct links to any online sessions will be posted our BIOS, CHEM, EAES, MATH, and PHYS schedules.
Please reach out to us if you have any questions, as we are always here for support!  Please contact our team by email (mslc@uic.edu) or Live Chat!
We are excited for you to join us as we ask questions, explore challenging concepts, develop new ideas, and learn together!
