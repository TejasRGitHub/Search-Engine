Student Assistance offers help to students in addressing the complex crises, life traumas, and barriers that may adversely affect their academic success or collegiate experience. Student Assistance empowers students to take an active role in their education by helping them evaluate and connect with the resources and options available to address their situation.
Student Assistance can support with issues including, but not limited to, personal and family emergencies, academics, interpersonal conflicts, personal safety, transition issues, and physical and mental health concerns.
