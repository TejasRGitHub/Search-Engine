About

As a Lecturer in the UIC Computer Science Department, I teach in the general area of software engineering. Previous courses taught include:

CS 111. Program Design 1
CS 141. Program Design 2
CS 342. Software Design
CS 341. Programming Language Design and Implementation
CS 478. Software Development for Mobile Platforms

Research:
In addition to teaching I am the Director of the Caterpillar Research Lab and Co-Director of the OSF HealthCare Lab. These are both corporate sponsored, interdisciplinary research labs located at the UIC Innovation Center.
The Caterpillar Research Lab is focused on identifying innovative business opportunities, solving safety issues, creating new service models and improving machine and user performance to enhance overall efficiency. Caterpillar Inc. is a Fortune 100 corporation and the worlds largest construction equipment manufacturer. Some of the lab’s research has involved leveraging machine learning algorithms to interpret sensor data in real time and creating sensor networks, incorporating wearable technology, to improve overall safety and efficiency for large scale operations.
The OSF HealthCare Lab uses human-centered design and design-thinking methodologies of user research, collaboration, and prototyping & testing to understand, identify and design solutions that fit the needs of under served populations. OSF, based in Peoria IL with over 150 primary care and specialist offices and services, is at the forefront of innovation and technology providing downstate Illinois and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Research in the lab focuses on new service offerings, products, apps, business models, process performance improvements, data visualizations and knowledge frameworks.
