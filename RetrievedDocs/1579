            The Equity and Inclusion in Engineering Program (EIEP) supports the transition to UIC Engineering for historically underrepresented populations, first-generation students, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community; and encourages their persistence in the engineering and technology fields. EIEP also provides academic advising, scholarship opportunities, mentorship, and various programs to enhance students’ experience at UIC.

“There is a strong sense of community [in this program]. You end up forming your own little family at school that you can always go to for help. I am still in contact with peers who already graduated, and I know that’s a network I will always rely on.”

UIC is located on the traditional homelands of the Three Fire Peoples — the Ojibwe, Odawa, Bodéwadmi, and other Nations such as the Menominee, Ho-Chunk, Miami, and many other Indigenous Peoples. The U of I System carries out its mission in its namesake state, Illinois, and has a responsibility to acknowledge these Native Nations and to work with them as we move forward as a vibrant, inclusive institution.
