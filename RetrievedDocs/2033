UIC Pop-Up Pantry - Feeding the Flames since 2014
The mission of the Pop-Up Pantry is to exclusively serve registered UIC students who are experiencing food insecurity while attending the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  Our mission is to support academic success and student development by supporting students who may be facing personal and/or financial hardship.  It is especially important that during these college years, all students have access to a steady supply of nutritious food. Research shows that proper nutrition is critical for cognitive function and memory. This means that every meal is a bridge to academic success.
