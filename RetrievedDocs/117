Increasing the participation and success of students from Latinx and underrepresented communities pursuing careers in the field of computing and computer science. We are a network of students working together to develop technical, leadership, and professional skills through an environment that encourages camaraderie and growth not only as an individual, but as a community. We are an organization dedicated to inclusivity and welcome all who share our vision.
