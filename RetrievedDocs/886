The Medical Accelerator for Devices (MAD) Lab is an internally-funded innovation lab structured to take promising medical device ideas from abstract thoughts to tangible concepts ready for our partners for further development. 
Through diverse perspectives from our interdisciplinary cohort of graduate students and faculty (Engineering, Medicine, Computer Science, Design, and Business), MAD Lab conducts clinical needs validation, generates innovative concept solutions, and provides a thorough outline of the potential market opportunity.
