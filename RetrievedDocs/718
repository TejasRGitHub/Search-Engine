Faculty Spotlight
New faculty member Assistant Professor Shih-Ying Cheng focuses on gender-based and intimate partner violence, and recent immigrants. She has worked with survivors of gender-based violence and admires their strength and resourcefulness. “But, I also see how vulnerable they can be. I had a client who was almost killed by her husband, and when I visited her in the hospital, I told myself that I didn’t want to see that happen again,” she says. Dr. Cheng was drawn to Jane Addams by the work being done with and on behalf of marginalized populations. “That is exactly what I want to pursue in my life and my career,” she says. “I want to be useful, and I want my research to be meaningful and have impact in the real world.”  Read more about Dr. Cheng »
