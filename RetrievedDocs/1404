Springfield Campus






            Our campus in the state's busy capital shares in UIS' amenities and enjoys strong ties to the city's healthcare leaders.
          Heading link

Like the best inventions, our Springfield campus was born to address a specific issue: the need for more and better-prepared nurses in the cities, small towns and rural communities of Central and Southern Illinois. It was natural that the highly ranked UIC College of Nursing—already embedded in four other Illinois cities beyond Chicago—would be part of that solution. It was also natural that we would partner with our sister campus, the University of Illinois Springfield, and Memorial Health System, with its two Magnet-designated hospitals. The result: A campus that produces critically thinking RNs and APRNs, educated in the best settings, who are prepared to deliver top-quality care where it’s needed most.











            NEW: UIS-UIC Guaranteed Admissions Program for undergraduates
          Heading link



 
Copy link



A new initiative known as the UIS-UIC GPPA Program is now allowing any student who is interested in pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree to apply to UIS as a freshman and simultaneously apply to the GPPA program. If accepted in both, the student would be guaranteed admission to the UIC College of Nursing BSN program on the Springfield campus when they achieve junior-level standing.

We have a really small class size, which makes it easy for the instructors to be hands-on with us. Our instructors really care how we’re doing in the semester, and what we’re doing, and they want to help us.
