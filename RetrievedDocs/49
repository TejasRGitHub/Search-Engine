                Disability Resources
              


















UIC is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment that enables individuals with disabilities to fully access programs, services and all activities on campus.
To provide effective assistance to students with disabilities, the Disability Resource Center provides a broad range of services, from eligibility documentation, assistive technology, deaf/hard of hearing services and classroom access to exam accommodations, note taking, computing resources and transportation. Ultimately, our goal is to help students with disabilities reach their maximum effectiveness and optimum level of performance.
