Center for Urban Education Leadership



The Center for Urban Education Leadership (CUEL) engages in research, development, dissemination, and policy advocacy to disrupt the systemic inequality that affects the lives of Pk-12 urban students and to improve the educational outcomes and life opportunities of PK-12 urban school students locally and throughout the world. It  accomplishes these outcomes by applying center expertise in the areas of educational leadership, organizational development, equity/social justice, and continuous improvement/improvement science as center staff members collaborate with other researchers and practitioners locally, nationally, and internationally. The CUEL is housed in UIC’s College of Education in Chicago, IL.
