Workshop performances of “Hummingbird” were held at UIC’s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) June 18- 20. The Hummingbird project is a collaboration between UIC and the Goodman Theatre that blends virtual reality storytelling and performance, with the goal of encouraging stronger theatrical engagement with tech-savvy younger generation audiences. It is an immersive play developed by Daria Tsoupikova, professor in the school of design, Jo Cattell, an award-winning theater director, and members of the EVL, including Andrew Johnson, interim director and director of research. A theatrical premiere is planned for this fall.
Read about the development of the project, and the workshops.
