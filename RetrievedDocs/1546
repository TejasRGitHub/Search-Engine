UIC Engineering alumni are 26,000 strong. This website is designed to help you meet more of them.
Alumni programming runs throughout the year. Our site has a new calendar (see the Events page) that gives you a sense of what’s happening on campus, in Illinois and around the Midwest, and sometimes even elsewhere in the country. If you have ideas for events, please do let us know.
Alumni opportunities are everywhere—especially if you want to work with current students. Our alumni act as mentors to undergraduates, evaluate seniors’ design projects at the annual Expo, and visit with classes and clubs on return visits to campus. If you would like to be more involved, we encourage you to get in touch!
