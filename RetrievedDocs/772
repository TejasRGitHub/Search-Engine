NOTE: Due to social distancing mandates related to COVID-19, we will not have pickup service for transcripts until further notice.
The official transcript is the University’s statement of a student’s academic record issued by the Office of the Registrar. It lists all courses completed and grades earned in chronological order by term. Transcripts also contain notations of distinctions, transfer coursework summary, academic status, administrative actions and degrees received.
Immediately after a term’s final exams have ended, transcripts listing final grades may not be available for a period of up to two weeks. Transcripts listing final degree awarded may not be available for a period of four to six weeks following final exams of the final term in which the degree is earned.

            Hold Transcript for Grades or Degree
          

A request may be submitted to delay printing the transcript until after grades are posted or degrees for the current semester have been recorded on the transcript.  However, if you are expecting a grade change, do not order your transcript until you are sure the grade has been changed. The Registrar will not hold transcripts for maintenance or grade changes.
Transcript orders held for degrees are released approximately a day or two after your degree has been awarded in the system. If the status of your degree in Academic History of Self Service indicates that the degree has been Awarded and is no longer Pending prior to the release date listed on the Academic Calendar, you may contact the Transcripts Department and request that the Hold for Degree be removed and your transcript order processed.
