            Welcome to the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience!

The Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience is a unique interdisciplinary entity bringing together faculty from the Natural Sciences (Biology and Chemistry), Social Sciences (Psychology) and Humanities (Philosophy).
Because of the interdisciplinary nature of neuroscience, our endeavors expand to other units in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, as well as other colleges, e.g. Applied Health Sciences, Engineering, Education, Medicine and Pharmacy. This breadth of intellectual inquiry represents our greatest strength in the pursuit of excellence in research and teaching – aimed towards understanding brain-behavior relationships.
