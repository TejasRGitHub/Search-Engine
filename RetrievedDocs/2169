All Members must make an appointment with a CampusCare Primary Care Provider to receive authorization or a referral, before seeking care with a specialty physician in order to be covered under the CampusCare benefits. A CampusCare Primary Care Provider  is the first person a Member should contact whether for routine care, illness, injury, urgent or Emergency Care. Members do not need to contact their CampusCare Primary Care Provider in the event of an emergency as defined  by the Emergency Care Guidelines in the CampusCare Certificate of Coverage.
Unauthorized services provided outside of a CampusCare Primary Care Provider are the enrolled Member’s full financial responsibility.
For additional information about benefits, limitations, and exclusions please refer to the CampusCare Certificate of Coverage.
