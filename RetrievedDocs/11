                                Academic advising

            Academic advising
          

For advising information, visit the CS advising page.
All UIC College of Engineering undergraduates are required to meet with an academic advisor before they are able to register for classes each semester. An “advising hold” will be placed on your account, which will not be removed until you have completed an advising meeting. In fall and spring, you will receive an email about signing up for an appointment. You should complete your appointment before registration becomes available in the 11th week of the semester.
If you do not hear from your advisor by the ninth week of the semester, we encourage you to reach out to your advisor immediately.
When you come to your advising meeting, you must bring your DARS report, list of courses you are interested in taking for the next semester, and any questions you have. During or after the advising meeting, fill out the advising form with your advisor and submit it to the CS Student Affairs office in SEO 905. Keep your white copy for your records. Staff in the office will remove your advising hold within two to three business days. If you have questions, contact Student Affairs at 312-413-4950/ 312-996-2290 or cs-ugrad@cs.uic.edu.










            Students with disabilities
          

UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. Students who face or anticipate disability-related barriers while at UIC should connect with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) on the web at drc.uic.edu, by email at drc@uic.edu, or by phone at (312) 413-2183 to create a plan for reasonable accommodations.
In order to receive accommodations, students must disclose disability to the DRC, complete an interactive registration process with the DRC, and provide their course instructor with a Letter of Accommodation. Course instructors in receipt of a Letter of Accommodation will work with the student and the DRC to implement approved accommodations.

“I knew I liked building things and solving problems, so engineering seemed like a good fit for me. On campus, I spend a lot of time in the CS Lounge. There are so many like-minded people in the same space helping one another out. It’s inspiring and motivating. Off campus, my favorite place in Chicago is Indian Boundary Park Pond. It’s a medium-sized pond that has turtles in it, and it’s a great spot to relax and forget about all your worries.”
