BMES is a student-led organization within UIC’s Bioengineering Department that aims to bring together creative and intellectual individuals to facilitate professional development, catalyze hands-on learning through student-led projects, and promote awareness of scientific advancements within the fields of Bioengineering and Medicine. We strive to encourage peer mentoring, encourage diversity in our field, and provide a platform for student leadership. Whether student interests are in pursuing a future in medicine, industry, graduate school, or research, we have plenty of opportunities that will benefit all of our members, including a number of social events throughout the year.
