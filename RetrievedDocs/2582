College of Engineering 


















Welcome! I’m a Professor in UIC’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, which I joined in January 2009, after graduating from Harvard in 2007. I’m Belgian and Canadian, and live in Chicago with my Swedish husband Prof. Jakob Eriksson. I love to explore.
