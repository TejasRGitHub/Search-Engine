Undergraduate Student Groups






Undergraduate Student Groups
More than 30 student organizations call the UIC College of Engineering home. Some of these organizations serve as professional-development groups for students in certain majors or with particular interests, while other organizations build community among future Black engineers, Hispanic engineers, women, or veterans in engineering.
UIC Engineering students are encouraged to join as many student organizations as they like—and to take on leadership roles whenever possible. A student activities fair each fall provides an opportunity for students to talk to members of each of these organizations and make decisions on which ones to join.
