Dear Prospective Applicant,
Thank you for your interest in the training programs at the Counseling Center of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Our center has a strong commitment to training and has offered a training program since 1970. The UIC Counseling Center offers three graduate or post graduate psychology training programs: APA-Accredited Doctoral Internship, Advanced Psychotherapy Externship, and Post-Doctoral Fellowship. We also offer an undergraduate training program to prepare paraprofessionals to lead peer support groups.
We recognize that seeking quality training at the site that is best for you is a significant decision and hope that the information on these pages will be helpful. Through the links below, you will find information describing our setting and programs to assist you in your decisions regarding training next year, including information about our application procedures. Our intensive clinical core of training in multiculturally-competent psychotherapy across multiple modalities provides preparation for entry into a range of further training and employment opportunities, or for specialized training at the post-doctoral level. Trainees from clinical, counseling, and professional psychology programs across the country have gone on from the UIC Counseling Center to work in a variety of settings, including university counseling centers, medical settings, and private practice.
Our training staff is deeply committed to developing professionals and to the diverse community that we serve. We highly value the ideals of multiculturalism and social justice and strive to make these principles an integrated part of our training programs. We also take pride in our roles as supervisors and mentors, and seek to provide multiculturally competent clinical services, as well as multiculturally-competent supervision to those we train. We embrace the diversity and knowledge that our trainees add to the staff and hope that you will carefully consider our programs.
Respectfully,
Jeanette Simon, Psy.D., Associate Director for Training
Mirka Ivanovic, Psy.D.,  Assistant Director of Training
